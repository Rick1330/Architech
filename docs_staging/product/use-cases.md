# Use Cases: Architech

## 1. Introduction

This document describes the key use cases for Architech, illustrating how different user personas can leverage the platform to achieve their goals. These use cases highlight the practical applications of Architech and demonstrate its value in various stages of the software development lifecycle.

## 2. Core Use Cases

### 2.1. Designing and Validating a New Microservice Architecture

*   **User Persona:** Alex (Senior Software Engineer)
*   **Scenario:** Alex is tasked with designing a new e-commerce platform based on a microservices architecture. He needs to ensure the design is scalable, resilient, and performant.
*   **How Architech Helps:**
    1.  **Visual Design:** Alex uses Architech's visual canvas to drag-and-drop components like `Product Service`, `Order Service`, `Payment Gateway`, `Database`, and `Message Queue`. He connects them to represent the data flow and dependencies.
    2.  **Configuration:** He configures the properties of each component, such as processing times, database latencies, and queue capacities, based on his initial estimates.
    3.  **Simulation:** Alex runs a simulation to observe the system's behavior under a normal load. He analyzes the metrics to understand request latencies and identify potential bottlenecks.
    4.  **Fault Injection:** He injects faults, such as making the `Payment Gateway` unresponsive, to see how the system reacts. He observes that a failure in the payment gateway causes cascading failures in the `Order Service`.
    5.  **Design Iteration:** Based on these insights, Alex modifies his design to include a `Circuit Breaker` pattern for the `Payment Gateway` and a `Retry` mechanism with exponential backoff. He re-runs the simulation to validate that the system is now more resilient.
    6.  **Documentation & Communication:** Alex shares his final, validated design with his team, using the simulation results to explain his design choices and trade-offs.

### 2.2. Onboarding a New Engineer to a Complex System

*   **User Persona:** Sarah (System Architect)
*   **Scenario:** A new engineer has joined Sarah's team and needs to quickly understand the architecture of a complex, existing distributed system.
*   **How Architech Helps:**
    1.  **Interactive Exploration:** Sarah provides the new engineer with access to the Architech model of the existing system.
    2.  **Visual Understanding:** The new engineer can visually explore the components and their connections, getting a high-level overview of the architecture.
    3.  **Simulated Walkthrough:** The new engineer runs a simulation to see how requests flow through the system in real-time. He can observe the logs, metrics, and traces to understand the dynamic behavior of different components.
    4.  **Guided Learning:** Sarah uses the simulation to explain key architectural patterns and design decisions, such as why a particular database was chosen or how a specific service handles failures.
    5.  **Safe Experimentation:** The new engineer can experiment with the design in a safe sandbox environment, for example, by changing component properties or injecting faults, to deepen his understanding without affecting production systems.

### 2.3. Preparing for a Systems Design Interview

*   **User Persona:** Emily (Systems Design Interview Candidate)
*   **Scenario:** Emily has a systems design interview for a senior engineering role at a top tech company. She needs to practice designing a scalable social media platform.
*   **How Architech Helps:**
    1.  **Design Practice:** Emily uses Architech to design a system for a social media feed, including components like a `User Service`, `Post Service`, `Feed Generation Service`, `Cache`, and `Database`.
    2.  **Visual Feedback:** The visual canvas helps her organize her thoughts and create a clear, structured design.
    3.  **Simulation & Validation:** She runs a simulation to see how her design handles a high volume of requests. She observes that the `Feed Generation Service` is a bottleneck.
    4.  **AI-Guided Feedback:** Architech's AI assistant points out that her database design has a single point of failure and suggests using read replicas for scalability.
    5.  **Iterative Improvement:** Emily refines her design based on the simulation results and AI feedback, adding caching layers and database replicas. She re-runs the simulation to confirm that her design is now more scalable and resilient.
    6.  **Confidence Building:** By practicing with Architech, Emily gains confidence in her ability to design and articulate complex systems, preparing her for the real interview.

### 2.4. Testing Resilience with Chaos Engineering

*   **User Persona:** David (DevOps Engineer / SRE)
*   **Scenario:** David wants to proactively test the resilience of a critical production service to ensure it can withstand unexpected failures.
*   **How Architech Helps:**
    1.  **Model Production System:** David creates an Architech model that accurately represents the production service and its dependencies.
    2.  **Define Chaos Experiment:** He defines a chaos engineering experiment in Architech, consisting of a series of fault injections:
        *   Inject a latency spike in the database connection.
        *   Simulate a crash of one of the service instances.
        *   Introduce a network partition between the service and its cache.
    3.  **Run Experiment:** David runs the experiment in the safe simulation environment.
    4.  **Analyze Impact:** He analyzes the observability data (logs, metrics, traces) to understand how the system behaved during the experiment. He identifies that the service did not gracefully handle the network partition, leading to a significant increase in error rates.
    5.  **Implement Fixes:** Based on these findings, David works with the development team to implement a fallback mechanism for when the cache is unavailable.
    6.  **Validate Fix:** He re-runs the chaos experiment in Architech to verify that the fix has improved the system's resilience.

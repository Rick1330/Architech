*   **Role:** DevOps Engineer, SRE, or Infrastructure Engineer.
*   **Goals:**
    *   Ensure the reliability, availability, and performance of distributed systems in production.
    *   Design and implement robust monitoring, logging, and alerting solutions.
    *   Proactively identify and resolve production incidents.
    *   Improve system resilience through chaos engineering and fault tolerance mechanisms.
    *   Automate infrastructure and deployment processes.
*   **Pain Points:**
    *   Difficulty in reproducing complex production issues in lower environments.
    *   Lack of tools to simulate failure scenarios and test system resilience before deployment.
    *   Challenges in understanding the impact of infrastructure changes on application behavior.
    *   Need for better collaboration with development teams on system design for operational readiness.
*   **Technical Proficiency:** Strong in cloud infrastructure, automation, scripting, monitoring tools, and incident response. Values stability, automation, and operational efficiency.
*   **Architech Value Proposition:** Architech provides a safe, controlled environment to simulate failure modes, test resilience strategies, and validate operational readiness, enabling David to build more robust and observable systems.

### 2.4. Persona: The Systems Design Interview Candidate

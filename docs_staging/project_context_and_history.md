# Architech Project: Complete Context and History

## Project Overview

Architech is an interactive platform designed for the visual creation, configuration, simulation, and analysis of distributed systems. The project aims to provide engineers and architects with a powerful, intuitive visual design canvas to:

- Visually Design Architectures: Drag-and-drop components to build complex system diagrams
- Configure Components: Define properties and behaviors for each element in the system
- Simulate System Behavior: Run real-time simulations to observe data flow, performance, and interactions
- Analyze Results: Gain insights from metrics, logs, and visual traces to identify bottlenecks and optimize designs
- Manage Projects: Save, load, and version control different architectural designs

## Development Phases

### Phase 1-2: Foundation and Core Services
**Status: COMPLETED**
- Established project structure and monorepo architecture
- Implemented core backend services:
  - User Service (authentication, user management)
  - Project Service (project CRUD operations)
  - Design Service (design management, component definitions)
  - API Gateway (centralized routing and authentication)
- Set up PostgreSQL database with proper schemas
- Implemented JWT-based authentication
- Established Docker containerization for all services
- Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions

### Phase 3: Simulation Engine
**Status: COMPLETED**
- Implemented Go-based simulation engine for high-performance processing
- Added Simulation Orchestration Service (Python/FastAPI) for coordination
- Integrated WebSocket communication for real-time updates
- Added Redis for caching and session management
- Added Kafka for message queuing between services
- Implemented comprehensive logging and monitoring
- All services successfully containerized and orchestrated via docker-compose

### Phase 4: Frontend Integration (CURRENT PHASE)
**Status: IN PROGRESS**
- Previous attempt with Firebase Studio frontend failed due to CI/CD issues and poor integration
- New frontend built using lovable.dev with comprehensive features:
  - React 18+ with TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS with shadcn/ui components
  - Zustand for state management
  - React Flow for canvas functionality
  - WebSocket client for real-time simulation updates
  - Comprehensive test suite (unit, integration, E2E)
  - All CI/CD jobs passing (test, security scan, build, deploy)

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Services
1. **API Gateway** (Port 8000)
   - FastAPI-based central routing
   - JWT authentication middleware
   - Routes to all backend services

2. **User Service** (Port 8001)
   - User registration, authentication
   - JWT token management
   - User profile management

3. **Project Service** (Port 8002)
   - Project CRUD operations
   - Project ownership and permissions
   - Integration with Design Service

4. **Design Service** (Port 8003)
   - Design and component management
   - Version control for designs
   - Component property schemas (JSON Schema)
   - Design data stored as JSON blob

5. **Simulation Orchestration Service** (Port 8004)
   - Coordinates simulation execution
   - WebSocket endpoint for real-time updates
   - Integration with Go simulation engine

6. **Simulation Engine** (Port 8080)
   - Go-based high-performance simulation
   - Kafka integration for message processing
   - Redis for state management

### Database Schema
- PostgreSQL with comprehensive schemas for all services
- Proper foreign key relationships
- Support for design versioning and component definitions

### Infrastructure
- Docker Compose orchestration
- Redis for caching and sessions
- Kafka + Zookeeper for message queuing
- Comprehensive networking between services

## Key Integration Points

### Frontend-Backend Communication
1. **RESTful APIs**: All calls go through API Gateway at `/api/v1`
2. **WebSocket**: Direct connection to Simulation Orchestration Service for real-time updates
3. **Authentication**: Bearer token in Authorization header for all protected endpoints
4. **Design Data**: Canvas state serialized/deserialized to/from `design_data` JSON field

### Component System
- Backend stores component schemas with `properties_schema` (JSON Schema) and `default_properties`
- Frontend dynamically generates property forms based on these schemas
- Component types: GenericService, Database, MessageQueue, LoadBalancer, Cache, APIGateway

### Real-time Simulation
- WebSocket messages with structured JSON format
- Message types: `simulation_started`, `simulation_event`, `simulation_metric`
- Frontend updates UI based on real-time simulation data

## Current Status and Next Steps

### Completed in Current Session
1. âœ… Created `feature/frontend-evaluation-and-integration` branch from `develop`
2. âœ… Removed old incomplete frontend directory
3. âœ… Integrated lovable.dev frontend into Architech repository
4. âœ… Pushed changes to GitHub repository

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Run Backend Services**: Execute `docker-compose up -d` to start all backend services
2. **Install Frontend Dependencies**: Run `npm install` in frontend directory
3. **Configure Environment Variables**: Set up proper API endpoints in frontend `.env`
4. **Start Frontend**: Run `npm run dev` to start development server
5. **Verify Integration**: Test API calls and WebSocket connections
6. **Run Full Test Suite**: Execute all tests to ensure integration works
7. **Document Integration**: Create comprehensive integration documentation

### Known Issues
- Docker Compose experiencing `http+docker` URL scheme error in current sandbox
- This is an environmental issue, not a project configuration problem
- Fresh sandbox environment should resolve this issue

## Critical Context for Future Sessions

### Development Philosophy
- Monorepo approach for better coordination
- Microservices architecture with clear service boundaries
- API-first design with comprehensive documentation
- Test-driven development with high coverage
- CI/CD pipeline ensuring quality at every step

### Key Decisions Made
1. **Frontend Technology**: Chose React + TypeScript over Vue/Angular for ecosystem maturity
2. **State Management**: Zustand over Redux for simplicity and performance
3. **Canvas Library**: React Flow for node-based graph functionality
4. **Backend Language**: Python/FastAPI for rapid development, Go for simulation performance
5. **Database**: PostgreSQL for ACID compliance and complex relationships
6. **Authentication**: JWT tokens for stateless authentication
7. **Real-time**: WebSockets for simulation updates, not Server-Sent Events

### Integration Requirements
- Frontend must serialize canvas state to `design_data` JSON field
- Dynamic property forms based on backend component schemas
- WebSocket client must handle structured JSON messages
- All API calls must include Bearer token authentication
- Environment variables must be configurable for different deployment environments

## Project Goals and Success Criteria

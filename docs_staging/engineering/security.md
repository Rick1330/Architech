# Security: Architech

## 1. Introduction

Security is a foundational pillar in the design, development, and operation of Architech. As a platform that handles user-created system designs and potentially sensitive architectural information, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data is paramount. This document outlines our comprehensive security strategy, covering various aspects from application security to infrastructure security.

## 2. Security Principles

Our security strategy is guided by the following principles:

*   **Security by Design:** Security considerations are integrated into every phase of the software development lifecycle, from initial design to deployment and maintenance.
*   **Least Privilege:** Users and services are granted only the minimum necessary permissions to perform their functions.
*   **Defense in Depth:** Multiple layers of security controls are implemented to provide redundancy and resilience against attacks.
*   **Zero Trust:** We operate on the assumption that no user or system, inside or outside our network, should be implicitly trusted.
*   **Continuous Security:** Security is an ongoing process, involving continuous monitoring, regular audits, and prompt response to vulnerabilities.

## 3. Application Security

### 3.1. Authentication and Authorization

*   **Strong Authentication:** We will support robust authentication mechanisms, including multi-factor authentication (MFA) for user accounts.
*   **Secure Password Management:** Passwords will be hashed and salted using industry-standard algorithms (e.g., bcrypt) and never stored in plain text.
*   **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):** Access to features and data will be controlled based on predefined roles (e.g., user, admin, read-only). Permissions will be granular, ensuring users can only access and modify their own projects and designs.
*   **API Security:** All API endpoints will be secured using industry-standard protocols (e.g., OAuth2, JWT). API requests will be validated and rate-limited to prevent abuse.

### 3.2. Input Validation and Output Encoding

*   **Strict Input Validation:** All user inputs will be rigorously validated on both the client and server sides to prevent common vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), and Command Injection.
*   **Output Encoding:** All data rendered in the frontend will be properly encoded to prevent XSS attacks.

### 3.3. Session Management

*   **Secure Session Tokens:** Session tokens will be generated securely, stored encrypted, and transmitted over HTTPS only. They will have appropriate expiration times and be invalidated upon logout or suspicious activity.

### 3.4. Secure Coding Practices

*   **OWASP Top 10:** Developers will be trained on and adhere to secure coding practices, with a focus on mitigating risks identified in the OWASP Top 10.
*   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Code will be regularly scanned using SAST tools to identify potential security vulnerabilities early in the development cycle.
*   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Deployed applications will be scanned using DAST tools to identify runtime vulnerabilities.

## 4. Data Security

### 4.1. Data Encryption

*   **Encryption at Rest:** All sensitive data stored in databases and file systems will be encrypted at rest using strong encryption algorithms (e.g., AES-256).
*   **Encryption in Transit:** All communication between clients and servers, and between internal services, will be encrypted using TLS/SSL.

### 4.2. Data Backup and Recovery

*   **Regular Backups:** All critical data will be regularly backed up to secure, offsite locations.
*   **Disaster Recovery Plan:** A comprehensive disaster recovery plan will be in place and regularly tested to ensure business continuity in the event of a major incident.

### 4.3. Data Retention and Deletion

*   **Data Minimization:** We will only collect and retain data that is necessary for the operation of the platform and to provide value to our users.
*   **Secure Deletion:** When data is no longer needed, it will be securely deleted in accordance with data retention policies.

## 5. Infrastructure Security

### 5.1. Network Security

*   **Firewalls:** Network firewalls will be configured to restrict traffic to only necessary ports and protocols.
*   **Network Segmentation:** Our infrastructure will be segmented into logical networks to isolate critical services and limit the blast radius of any potential breach.
*   **Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS):** Systems will be in place to detect and prevent malicious network activity.

### 5.2. Host Security

*   **Hardened Images:** All virtual machines and containers will be built from hardened, minimal images.
*   **Regular Patching:** Operating systems, libraries, and applications will be regularly patched to address known vulnerabilities.
*   **Endpoint Protection:** Anti-malware and host-based intrusion detection systems will be deployed on all hosts.

### 5.3. Cloud Security

*   **Cloud Provider Best Practices:** We will adhere to the security best practices recommended by our cloud provider (e.g., AWS, GCP, Azure).
*   **Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Cloud IAM roles and policies will be configured with the principle of least privilege.
*   **Security Groups/Network ACLs:** Network access to cloud resources will be tightly controlled using security groups and network access control lists.

## 6. Security Monitoring and Incident Response

*   **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM):** Logs from all systems will be fed into a SIEM solution for centralized monitoring, correlation, and analysis of security events.
*   **Vulnerability Management:** We will have a process for continuously identifying, assessing, and remediating security vulnerabilities.
*   **Incident Response Plan:** A well-defined incident response plan will be in place to effectively detect, respond to, and recover from security incidents.
*   **Regular Audits and Penetration Testing:** We will conduct regular security audits and engage third-party penetration testers to identify weaknesses in our systems.

## 7. Compliance

We will strive to comply with relevant industry standards and regulations (e.g., GDPR, SOC 2) as appropriate for the nature of our service and the data we handle.

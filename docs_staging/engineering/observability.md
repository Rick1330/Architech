# Observability in Architech

## 1. Introduction

Observability is a first-class citizen in the design and operation of Architech. It is the practice of instrumenting our systems to provide high-fidelity data about their internal state, enabling us to understand, debug, and optimize their behavior. This document outlines our observability strategy, covering the three pillars of observability: logs, metrics, and traces.

## 2. The Three Pillars of Observability

### 2.1. Logs

*   **What they are:** Structured, timestamped records of discrete events that occur within our services.
*   **Our Approach:**
    *   **Structured Logging:** All logs will be emitted in a structured format (e.g., JSON) to facilitate easy parsing, searching, and analysis.
    *   **Log Levels:** We will use standard log levels (e.g., `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`) to categorize the severity of log messages.
    *   **Centralized Logging:** Logs from all services will be collected and aggregated into a centralized logging system (e.g., Elasticsearch, Loki).
    *   **Correlation IDs:** Every request will be assigned a unique correlation ID that is propagated through all services, allowing us to easily trace the entire lifecycle of a request through our logs.

### 2.2. Metrics

*   **What they are:** Numerical measurements collected over time that represent the health and performance of our systems.
*   **Our Approach:**
    *   **Standardized Metrics:** We will use a standardized naming convention for our metrics to ensure consistency across all services.
    *   **Key Metrics to Track:**
        *   **Request Rate:** The number of requests per second (RPS) being handled by each service.
        *   **Error Rate:** The percentage of requests that result in an error.
        *   **Latency:** The time it takes for a service to process a request (e.g., average, 95th percentile, 99th percentile).
        *   **Saturation:** How "full" a service is (e.g., CPU utilization, memory usage, queue depth).
    *   **Monitoring and Alerting:** We will use a time-series database (e.g., Prometheus, InfluxDB) to store our metrics and a monitoring tool (e.g., Grafana) to visualize them. We will set up alerts on key metrics to be notified of potential issues before they impact users.

### 2.3. Traces

*   **What they are:** A representation of the end-to-end journey of a request as it flows through multiple services in our distributed system.
*   **Our Approach:**
    *   **Distributed Tracing:** We will use a distributed tracing system (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin) to collect and visualize traces.
    *   **OpenTelemetry:** We will use the OpenTelemetry standard for instrumenting our services to generate traces, ensuring vendor-neutrality and a consistent approach across our polyglot microservices.
    *   **Trace Analysis:** Traces will be used to understand the dependencies between services, identify performance bottlenecks, and debug complex issues that span multiple services.

## 3. Observability in the Simulation Engine

The Architech simulation engine itself is a powerful observability tool, providing insights into the behavior of users' designed systems. We will apply the same observability principles to the simulation engine itself, allowing users to observe their simulations in the same way we observe our own production systems.

*   **Simulation Logs:** The simulation engine will generate detailed, structured logs of all events that occur during a simulation.
*   **Simulation Metrics:** The engine will generate time-series metrics for each component in the simulated system, allowing users to visualize performance and resource utilization.
*   **Simulation Traces:** The engine will generate distributed traces for requests flowing through the simulated system, providing a clear view of the request path and latency breakdown.

By providing this rich observability data, we empower our users to gain deep insights into their system designs and make informed decisions.

## 4. Culture of Observability

Observability is not just about tools; it's about a culture of curiosity and data-driven decision-making. We will foster this culture by:

*   **Making Observability Accessible:** Providing easy-to-use tools and dashboards for all engineers.
*   **Encouraging Proactive Monitoring:** Encouraging engineers to actively monitor the health of their services and investigate potential issues.
*   **Using Observability for Continuous Improvement:** Using the insights gained from our observability data to continuously improve the performance, reliability, and resilience of our systems.

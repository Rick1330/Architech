# System Behavior Specification: Architech Simulation Engine

## 1. Introduction

This document specifies the expected behavior of the Architech simulation engine, detailing how various components interact and how system-level properties emerge from these interactions. The simulation engine is the core of Architech, responsible for accurately modeling distributed system dynamics, including request flow, latency, resource utilization, and failure propagation. This specification serves as a foundational reference for the development, testing, and validation of the simulation engine.

## 2. Core Concepts

### 2.1. Discrete Event Simulation (DES)

The Architech simulation engine operates on a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) paradigm. In DES, the system's state changes only at discrete points in time, corresponding to specific events. The simulation progresses by processing events in chronological order. Key elements of our DES model include:

*   **Events:** Atomic occurrences that change the state of the system (e.g., `RequestArrival`, `ServiceProcessingComplete`, `NetworkPacketSent`, `FaultInjection`). Each event has a timestamp and associated data.
*   **Simulation Clock:** A logical clock that advances from one event time to the next, not necessarily in real-time.
*   **Event Queue (Future Event List):** A prioritized list of future events, ordered by their timestamp. The simulation engine continuously extracts and processes the earliest event from this queue.
*   **System State:** The collection of all relevant variables that describe the system at any given time (e.g., number of requests in a queue, service utilization, component status).

### 2.2. Components

Components are the building blocks of a system design in Architech. Each component type has a defined set of behaviors, properties, and interaction mechanisms.

*   **Generic Service:** Represents a microservice or application logic unit. Its primary behavior is to process incoming requests, incurring a configurable processing delay. It can send requests to other services or databases.
*   **Database:** Models data storage. Behaviors include read and write operations, each with configurable latencies. Databases can have capacity limits and connection pool behaviors.
*   **Message Queue:** Models asynchronous communication. Behaviors include enqueuing and dequeuing messages, with configurable capacities, processing delays, and potential for message loss under overflow conditions.
*   **Load Balancer:** Distributes incoming requests among multiple instances of a service based on a configurable strategy (e.g., round-robin, least connections).
*   **Cache:** Models a caching layer. Behaviors include cache hit/miss logic, configurable hit rates, and associated latencies for cache access and origin fetches.
*   **Network Link:** Implicitly models the communication channel between components, introducing configurable latency and potential for packet loss or reordering.

### 2.3. Requests

Requests are the primary units of work flowing through the simulated system. Each request carries metadata (e.g., unique ID, origin timestamp, current path, payload size) and triggers events as it moves between components.

## 3. Component Behavior Specification

### 3.1. Request Flow and Processing

1.  **Request Generation:** A `RequestGenerator` component (external to the user's design, but part of the simulation setup) injects `RequestArrival` events into the system at a specified rate (e.g., requests per second, using a Poisson distribution for realism).
2.  **Entry Point:** The `RequestArrival` event targets a designated entry component (e.g., a Load Balancer or a Service).
3.  **Service Processing:**
    *   Upon receiving a request, a `Service` component begins processing. A `ServiceProcessingComplete` event is scheduled for `current_time + processing_delay`.
    *   During processing, the service's `utilization` metric increases.
    *   If a service has dependencies (e.g., calls a Database or another Service), it sends sub-requests. The main request's processing is paused until all sub-requests return.
    *   Upon `ServiceProcessingComplete`, the service's `utilization` decreases. The request is then forwarded or returned to the caller.
4.  **Database Interaction:**
    *   A `Service` sends a `DatabaseRequest` event to a `Database` component.
    *   The `Database` processes the request (read/write) and schedules a `DatabaseOperationComplete` event for `current_time + read/write_latency`.
    *   Upon completion, a `DatabaseResponse` is sent back to the calling `Service`.
5.  **Message Queue Interaction:**
    *   A `Service` sends an `EnqueueMessage` event to a `MessageQueue`.
    *   If the queue is not full, the message is added, and an `EnqueueComplete` event is scheduled. If full, the message is rejected or an `Overflow` event is triggered.
    *   Consumers (e.g., other Services) send `DequeueMessage` events. If messages are available, one is dequeued, and a `DequeueComplete` event is scheduled.
6.  **Load Balancer Behavior:**
    *   Upon receiving a request, a `LoadBalancer` selects a backend service instance based on its configured strategy.
    *   The request is then forwarded to the selected instance.

### 3.2. Latency and Throughput

*   **Network Latency:** A configurable base latency is applied to all inter-component communication. This can be extended to per-link latencies in advanced phases.
*   **Processing Latency:** Each component has a configurable processing delay for its operations.
*   **Queueing Delay:** Requests entering a queue will experience a delay proportional to the current queue length and the rate at which messages are dequeued.
*   **Throughput:** The simulation engine calculates throughput as the number of requests successfully processed per unit of simulation time.

### 3.3. Resource Utilization

*   **CPU/Memory:** Services and databases will have simulated CPU and memory utilization metrics that increase during active processing and decrease when idle. This can be used to identify resource bottlenecks.
*   **Network Bandwidth:** Simulated network links will have bandwidth limits. Exceeding these limits will result in increased latency or packet loss.

## 4. Fault Injection Behavior

Architech supports injecting various faults to test system resilience. When a fault is injected, the simulation engine modifies the behavior of targeted components or network links.

### 4.1. Component Failure

*   **Behavior:** A targeted component (e.g., Service instance, Database) becomes unresponsive or crashes for a specified duration.
*   **Impact:** Requests sent to the failed component will either timeout, be rejected immediately, or be dropped, depending on the calling component's retry/timeout configuration.
*   **Recovery:** After the specified duration, the component resumes normal operation.

### 4.2. Network Partition

*   **Behavior:** Communication between specified groups of components is severed for a duration.
*   **Impact:** Requests attempting to cross the partition boundary will fail (timeout/drop).
*   **Recovery:** Communication is restored after the duration.

### 4.3. Latency Spike

*   **Behavior:** The processing latency of a component or the network latency of a link is artificially increased for a duration.
*   **Impact:** Requests passing through the affected component/link will experience significantly higher delays.

### 4.4. Resource Exhaustion

*   **Behavior:** A component's simulated CPU or memory resources are artificially capped, leading to increased processing times or request rejections if capacity is exceeded.
*   **Impact:** Performance degradation, increased latency, or failures for requests handled by the affected component.

## 5. Observability Data Generation

During simulation, the engine continuously generates observability data:

*   **Logs:** Events like `RequestArrival`, `ServiceProcessingStart`, `ServiceProcessingComplete`, `ErrorOccurred`, `FaultInjected` are logged with timestamps and relevant metadata.
*   **Metrics:** Key performance indicators (KPIs) are collected and updated at regular intervals (e.g., every simulated second):
    *   **Component-level:** Request count, average latency, error rate, CPU/memory utilization, queue length.
    *   **System-level:** Total throughput, end-to-end latency percentiles.
*   **Traces:** Each request is assigned a unique trace ID. As a request traverses components, span information (component ID, start time, end time, status) is recorded, allowing for reconstruction of the full request path and latency breakdown.

## 6. Interaction with AI Service

The simulation engine will provide its generated observability data (logs, metrics, traces) to the AI Service. The AI Service will then analyze this data to identify anti-patterns, suggest optimizations, and provide feedback, which can then be presented to the user through the Frontend.

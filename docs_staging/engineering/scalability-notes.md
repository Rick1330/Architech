# Scalability Notes: Architech

## 1. Introduction

Scalability is a fundamental requirement for Architech, ensuring that the platform can effectively handle a growing number of users, increasingly complex system designs, and large-scale simulations without degradation in performance or availability. This document outlines the key strategies and considerations for achieving horizontal and vertical scalability across all components of the Architech platform.

## 2. Principles of Scalability

Our approach to scalability is guided by the following principles:

*   **Horizontal Scaling (Scale Out):** Prefer adding more instances of a component rather than increasing the capacity of a single instance. This is achieved by designing stateless services and distributing load across multiple nodes.
*   **Statelessness:** Design services to be stateless wherever possible. Any necessary state should be externalized to a distributed data store (e.g., database, cache, message queue).
*   **Asynchronous Communication:** Utilize message queues and event streams to decouple services, allowing them to process requests independently and absorb bursts of traffic.
*   **Loose Coupling:** Minimize dependencies between services to enable independent deployment, scaling, and failure isolation.
*   **Data Partitioning:** Distribute data across multiple database instances or shards to handle growing data volumes and query loads.
*   **Caching:** Employ caching mechanisms at various layers to reduce the load on backend services and databases.

## 3. Scalability Strategies by Component

### 3.1. Frontend (Client-side Application)

*   **Content Delivery Network (CDN):** Serve static assets (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images) from a CDN to reduce latency and offload traffic from origin servers.
*   **Client-side Optimization:** Optimize frontend code for efficient rendering and reduced bundle sizes to improve perceived performance and responsiveness.
*   **WebSockets for Real-time Updates:** Use WebSockets for real-time collaboration and simulation updates to minimize overhead compared to traditional polling.

### 3.2. Backend Services

Backend services are designed as microservices, enabling independent scaling of each service based on its specific load characteristics.

*   **Containerization & Orchestration:**
    *   **Docker:** Package each microservice into a Docker container for consistent deployment across environments.
    *   **Kubernetes:** Use Kubernetes (or similar container orchestration platform) to manage, deploy, and automatically scale microservice instances based on CPU utilization, memory consumption, or custom metrics (e.g., queue depth).
*   **Load Balancing:**
    *   **API Gateway:** The API Gateway will distribute incoming requests across multiple instances of backend services.
    *   **Internal Load Balancers:** Kubernetes services will provide internal load balancing for inter-service communication.
*   **Connection Pooling:** Efficiently manage database and other external service connections to minimize overhead.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Implement rate limiting at the API Gateway and individual service levels to protect against abuse and ensure fair resource usage.

### 3.3. Simulation Engine

The simulation engine is the most computationally intensive component and requires dedicated scalability strategies.

*   **Distributed Simulation:** For very large or long-running simulations, explore distributing the simulation workload across multiple compute nodes. This could involve:
    *   **Partitioning the Simulation:** Dividing the simulated system into sub-systems that can be simulated concurrently on different nodes.
    *   **Event Distribution:** Distributing the event processing across multiple workers.
*   **Stateless Simulation Workers:** Design simulation workers to be stateless, allowing them to be easily scaled up or down based on demand. The simulation state would be managed externally (e.g., in a distributed in-memory data store or persistent storage).
*   **High-Performance Computing (HPC) Techniques:** Investigate using specialized HPC techniques or hardware (e.g., GPUs) for accelerating complex simulation calculations.
*   **Batch Processing:** For non-real-time simulations, process simulation requests in batches to optimize resource utilization.

### 3.4. Data Storage

Architech uses a polyglot persistence strategy, and each data store requires its own scaling approach.

*   **Relational Database (PostgreSQL):**
    *   **Read Replicas:** Use read replicas to scale read operations, offloading them from the primary database.
    *   **Connection Pooling:** Efficiently manage database connections from backend services.
    *   **Sharding (Future):** For extreme scale, implement database sharding to distribute data across multiple database instances based on a sharding key (e.g., `user_id` or `project_id`).
*   **Time-Series Database (e.g., InfluxDB, Prometheus):**
    *   These databases are inherently designed for scalability and high-volume ingestion. We will leverage their native clustering and replication features.
*   **Document Database/Log Management System (e.g., MongoDB, Elasticsearch):**
    *   **Sharding/Clustering:** Utilize the native sharding or clustering capabilities of these systems to distribute data and query load across multiple nodes.
    *   **Indexing:** Optimize indexing strategies for fast search and aggregation of logs and traces.

### 3.5. Message Queue / Event Bus

*   **Clustering & Replication:** Deploy the message queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) in a clustered and replicated configuration to ensure high availability and scalability.
*   **Consumer Groups:** Utilize consumer groups to allow multiple instances of a service to process messages concurrently from a single topic or queue.

## 4. Monitoring and Auto-Scaling

*   **Comprehensive Monitoring:** Implement robust monitoring across all components to track key performance indicators (KPIs) such as CPU utilization, memory usage, network I/O, request latency, error rates, and queue depths.
*   **Auto-Scaling:** Configure auto-scaling policies in Kubernetes (for microservices) and cloud providers (for databases, message queues) to automatically adjust the number of instances based on demand and predefined thresholds.

## 5. Performance Testing

*   **Load Testing:** Regularly conduct load tests to simulate anticipated user loads and identify performance bottlenecks before they impact production.
*   **Stress Testing:** Perform stress tests to determine the breaking point of the system and understand its behavior under extreme conditions.
*   **Scalability Testing:** Verify that the system scales linearly with increased resources.

By implementing these strategies, Architech will be built to handle significant growth in users and complexity, providing a reliable and performant experience for all.

# Fault Injection Strategy: Architech

## 1. Introduction

Fault injection is a critical capability of Architech, enabling engineers to proactively test the resilience of their distributed systems by simulating various failure scenarios. This document outlines the strategy for implementing and utilizing fault injection within the Architech platform. Our approach is designed to be comprehensive, flexible, and user-friendly, allowing for both simple, targeted fault injections and complex, orchestrated chaos engineering experiments.

## 2. Goals of Fault Injection in Architech

*   **Identify Single Points of Failure (SPOFs):** Uncover components whose failure would lead to a complete system outage.
*   **Detect Cascading Failures:** Observe how failures in one part of the system propagate and potentially cause failures in other, seemingly unrelated parts.
*   **Validate Resilience Patterns:** Verify the effectiveness of implemented resilience patterns such as circuit breakers, retries, fallbacks, and bulkheads.
*   **Assess Performance Under Duress:** Understand how the system performs under degraded conditions (e.g., high latency, resource contention).
*   **Improve Observability:** Ensure that monitoring and alerting systems can effectively detect and diagnose failures.
*   **Build Confidence in System Robustness:** Provide engineers with the confidence that their systems can withstand real-world failures.

## 3. Fault Injection Mechanisms

Architech will support a wide range of fault injection mechanisms, categorized as follows:

### 3.1. Component-Level Faults

These faults target specific components within the system design.

*   **Component Crash/Unavailability:**
    *   **Description:** Simulates a component (e.g., a service instance, a database node) becoming completely unresponsive for a specified duration.
    *   **Parameters:** Target component(s), duration of failure.
    *   **Implementation:** The simulation engine will mark the component as `UNAVAILABLE`. Any requests directed to it will be rejected or timed out.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:**
    *   **Description:** Simulates a component running out of critical resources like CPU, memory, or connection pools.
    *   **Parameters:** Target component(s), resource type (CPU, memory), severity (e.g., 90% utilization), duration.
    *   **Implementation:** The component's processing latency will be increased proportionally to the resource exhaustion level. It may also start rejecting requests if a hard limit is reached.

### 3.2. Network-Level Faults

These faults target the communication links between components.

*   **Network Partition:**
    *   **Description:** Simulates a loss of connectivity between two or more components or groups of components.
    *   **Parameters:** Source component(s), destination component(s), duration.
    *   **Implementation:** The simulation engine will drop any packets attempting to cross the partition boundary.
*   **Latency Spike:**
    *   **Description:** Introduces a sudden, significant increase in network latency for specific communication links.
    *   **Parameters:** Source component(s), destination component(s), latency increase (e.g., +500ms), duration.
    *   **Implementation:** The specified latency will be added to all requests traversing the affected link.
*   **Packet Loss:**
    *   **Description:** Simulates the random dropping of network packets.
    *   **Parameters:** Source component(s), destination component(s), loss percentage (e.g., 10%), duration.
    *   **Implementation:** For each request on the affected link, a random check will determine if the packet is dropped.

### 3.3. Application-Level Faults

These faults target the application logic itself.

*   **Error Injection:**
    *   **Description:** Forces a component to return a specific error code (e.g., HTTP 500, database connection error) for a certain percentage of requests.
    *   **Parameters:** Target component, error type, error rate (e.g., 25% of requests), duration.
    *   **Implementation:** The component's logic will be modified to inject the specified error based on the configured rate.
*   **Slowdown:**
    *   **Description:** Introduces an artificial processing delay within a component's logic.
    *   **Parameters:** Target component, delay duration, percentage of requests affected.
    *   **Implementation:** The specified delay will be added to the component's processing time for affected requests.

## 4. Fault Injection Scenarios & Experiments

Architech will allow users to combine individual fault injections into complex scenarios or experiments, enabling more realistic and comprehensive resilience testing.

### 4.1. Scenario Definition

Users can define fault injection scenarios using a simple UI or a YAML-based configuration. A scenario consists of:

*   **A sequence of fault injections:** Each with its own start time, duration, and parameters.
*   **Target conditions:** Faults can be triggered based on specific system states (e.g., 


when a queue depth exceeds a threshold).

### 4.2. Experiment Execution

*   **Controlled Environment:** Experiments are run within the isolated simulation environment, ensuring reproducibility and preventing impact on real systems.
*   **Repeatability:** Scenarios can be saved and re-run multiple times to observe consistent behavior or test different mitigation strategies.
*   **Automated Analysis:** Post-experiment analysis tools will help identify the impact of faults on system performance, availability, and correctness.

## 5. Integration with Observability

Fault injection is most effective when combined with robust observability. Architech will ensure that:

*   **Fault Events are Logged:** Every fault injection event (start, end, type, parameters) is clearly logged and timestamped.
*   **Metrics Reflect Impact:** Key metrics (latency, error rates, throughput, resource utilization) will clearly show the impact of injected faults.
*   **Traces Highlight Affected Paths:** Request traces will visually indicate which parts of the system were affected by a fault, helping to pinpoint propagation paths.

## 6. AI-Assisted Fault Injection

In later phases, Architech will leverage its AI Service to enhance the fault injection process:

*   **Intelligent Fault Selection:** AI can suggest relevant fault types and injection points based on the system design and known anti-patterns.
*   **Automated Scenario Generation:** AI can generate complex chaos engineering scenarios designed to uncover specific vulnerabilities.
*   **Impact Prediction:** AI can predict the potential impact of a fault before it is injected, helping users understand risks.
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** AI can assist in analyzing simulation results to identify the root cause of failures observed during fault injection experiments.

## 7. Best Practices for Fault Injection

*   **Start Small:** Begin with simple, isolated fault injections before moving to complex scenarios.
*   **Define Hypotheses:** Before running an experiment, define what you expect to happen and what you are testing.
*   **Measure Impact:** Always monitor key metrics and observability data to understand the full impact of the fault.
*   **Automate:** Automate fault injection and analysis as much as possible to ensure repeatability and efficiency.
*   **Learn and Iterate:** Use the insights gained from fault injection to improve system design and resilience.

# Module: Component Library

## 1. Overview

The Component Library module provides a collection of pre-defined, reusable building blocks for constructing distributed system designs within Architech. These components represent common architectural elements such as services, databases, message queues, load balancers, and more. Each component encapsulates specific behaviors and configurable properties relevant to system simulation.

## 2. Key Responsibilities

*   **Standardized Components:** Offers a set of ready-to-use components that adhere to the `Component` interface defined by the Simulation Engine Core.
*   **Configurable Properties:** Allows users to customize component behavior through properties (e.g., processing time, capacity, latency, error rates).
*   **Extensibility:** Designed to be easily extendable, enabling the addition of new component types as the project evolves or through user-defined custom components.
*   **Serialization/Deserialization:** Provides mechanisms to convert component definitions to and from a persistent format (e.g., JSON) for storage in the Design Service.

## 3. Core Components and Files

### 3.1. `generic_service.go` (or `generic_service.py`)

*   **Description:** Represents a generic computational service. It processes incoming requests, potentially introduces latency, and can generate outgoing requests.
*   **Key Properties:**
    *   `ProcessingTimeDistribution`: Statistical distribution (e.g., constant, normal, exponential) for the time it takes to process a request.
    *   `ErrorRate`: Probability of the service failing to process a request.
    *   `Capacity`: Maximum number of concurrent requests the service can handle.
*   **Interactions:** Receives `RequestArrival` events, processes them, and emits `RequestProcessed` or `RequestFailed` events.

### 3.2. `database.go`

*   **Description:** Models a database component, handling read and write operations with configurable latencies and throughput.
*   **Key Properties:**
    *   `ReadLatencyDistribution`: Distribution for read operation latency.
    *   `WriteLatencyDistribution`: Distribution for write operation latency.
    *   `MaxConnections`: Maximum concurrent database connections.
*   **Interactions:** Receives `DatabaseReadRequest` or `DatabaseWriteRequest` events and emits `DatabaseReadResponse` or `DatabaseWriteResponse` events.

### 3.3. `message_queue.go`

*   **Description:** Simulates a message queuing system, handling message enqueueing and dequeueing with configurable delays and capacity.
*   **Key Properties:**
    *   `EnqueueLatencyDistribution`: Distribution for message enqueue latency.
    *   `DequeueLatencyDistribution`: Distribution for message dequeue latency.
    *   `MaxQueueSize`: Maximum number of messages the queue can hold.
*   **Interactions:** Receives `MessageEnqueue` events and emits `MessageDequeued` events.

### 3.4. `load_balancer.go`

*   **Description:** Models a load balancer distributing incoming requests among a pool of backend services using various algorithms.
*   **Key Properties:**
    *   `Algorithm`: Load balancing algorithm (e.g., Round Robin, Least Connections, Weighted).
    *   `BackendServices`: List of IDs of services behind the load balancer.
*   **Interactions:** Receives incoming requests and forwards them to one of its backend services based on the configured algorithm.

### 3.5. `network_link.go`

*   **Description:** Represents a network connection between two components, introducing latency and potential packet loss.
*   **Key Properties:**
    *   `LatencyDistribution`: Distribution for network latency.
    *   `PacketLossRate`: Probability of a message being lost during transit.
    *   `Bandwidth`: Maximum data transfer rate.
*   **Interactions:** Intercepts events traveling between connected components and applies network effects.

### 3.6. `component_factory.go`

*   **Description:** A factory pattern implementation responsible for creating instances of various component types based on their string identifier and configuration.
*   **Key Functions/Methods:**
    *   `CreateComponent(type string, config map[string]interface{}) (Component, error)`: Instantiates a component.
*   **Interactions:** Used by the Simulation Orchestration Service to build the simulation graph from a design.

## 4. Interaction with Other Modules

*   **Simulation Engine Core:** All components implement the `Component` interface from the Simulation Engine Core, allowing them to be integrated into the simulation loop.
*   **Design Service:** Component definitions and their configured properties are stored and retrieved from the Design Service.
*   **Frontend:** The Frontend uses the component definitions to populate the component palette and render components on the design canvas.
*   **AI Service:** The AI Service may analyze component configurations for anti-patterns or suggest optimal property values.

## 5. Design Considerations

*   **Parameterization:** Components should be highly parameterized to allow for flexible modeling of diverse system behaviors.
*   **Realism vs. Simplicity:** Balance the need for realistic modeling with the complexity of implementation and simulation performance.
*   **Modularity:** Each component should be self-contained and responsible for its own behavior.
*   **Error Handling:** Components should gracefully handle invalid configurations or unexpected events.

## 6. Verification

*   **Unit Tests:** Each component will have dedicated unit tests to verify its `HandleEvent` logic and property configuration.
*   **Integration Tests:** Test scenarios involving multiple components interacting to ensure correct behavior (e.g., a service sending a request to a database).
*   **Property Validation:** Ensure that component properties are correctly parsed and applied, and that invalid properties are rejected.
*   **Performance Benchmarks:** Measure the overhead introduced by each component during simulation.

# Module: Project Service

## 1. Overview

The Project Service manages user projects within the Architech platform. It provides functionality for creating, organizing, and managing projects that contain system designs and simulations. This service acts as a container and organizational layer for user work, enabling collaboration, version control, and project-level settings and permissions.

## 2. Key Responsibilities

*   **Project Management:** Handles creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of user projects.
*   **Project Organization:** Provides hierarchical organization of projects with support for folders and categorization.
*   **Access Control:** Manages project-level permissions and sharing capabilities.
*   **Project Metadata:** Stores and manages project descriptions, tags, creation dates, and other metadata.
*   **Project Templates:** Supports creation of projects from predefined templates for common use cases.
*   **Project Collaboration:** Enables sharing and collaborative editing of projects among multiple users.

## 3. Core Components and Files

### 3.1. `main.py`

*   **Description:** The FastAPI application entry point for the Project Service. It initializes the application, sets up middleware, and defines the main application instance.
*   **Key Functions/Methods:**
    *   Application initialization and configuration
    *   Middleware setup (CORS, logging, error handling)
    *   Database connection initialization
*   **Interactions:** Coordinates all other components within the Project Service.

### 3.2. `app/api/v1/endpoints/projects.py`

*   **Description:** Defines the RESTful API endpoints for project-related operations. This includes endpoints for project CRUD operations, sharing, and collaboration features.
*   **Key Endpoints:**
    *   `POST /projects`: Creates a new project
    *   `GET /projects`: Lists user's projects with filtering and pagination
    *   `GET /projects/{project_id}`: Retrieves a specific project
    *   `PUT /projects/{project_id}`: Updates project information
    *   `DELETE /projects/{project_id}`: Deletes a project
    *   `POST /projects/{project_id}/share`: Shares a project with other users
    *   `GET /projects/{project_id}/designs`: Lists designs within a project
*   **Interactions:** Uses CRUD operations from `app/crud/project.py` and schemas from `app/schemas/project.py`.

### 3.3. `app/db/models.py`

*   **Description:** Defines the SQLAlchemy ORM models for project-related database entities. This includes the Project model and related entities for collaboration and organization.
*   **Key Models:**
    *   `Project`: Core project entity with fields like id, name, description, owner_id, created_at, updated_at, is_public
    *   `ProjectCollaborator`: Manages user permissions for shared projects
    *   `ProjectTemplate`: Stores predefined project templates
    *   `ProjectTag`: Enables tagging and categorization of projects
*   **Interactions:** Used by CRUD operations and database migrations.

### 3.4. `app/schemas/project.py`

*   **Description:** Defines Pydantic schemas for request and response validation. These schemas ensure data integrity and provide clear API contracts for project operations.
*   **Key Schemas:**
    *   `ProjectCreate`: Schema for project creation requests
    *   `ProjectUpdate`: Schema for project update requests
    *   `ProjectResponse`: Schema for project data responses
    *   `ProjectList`: Schema for project listing responses
    *   `ProjectShare`: Schema for project sharing requests
*   **Interactions:** Used by API endpoints for request validation and response serialization.

### 3.5. `app/crud/project.py`

*   **Description:** Contains Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations for project entities. This layer abstracts database operations and provides a clean interface for project data manipulation.
*   **Key Functions/Methods:**
    *   `create_project(db: Session, project: ProjectCreate, owner_id: int) -> Project`: Creates a new project
    *   `get_project_by_id(db: Session, project_id: int) -> Project`: Retrieves a project by ID
    *   `get_user_projects(db: Session, user_id: int) -> List[Project]`: Gets all projects for a user
    *   `update_project(db: Session, project_id: int, project_update: ProjectUpdate) -> Project`: Updates project information
    *   `delete_project(db: Session, project_id: int) -> bool`: Deletes a project
    *   `share_project(db: Session, project_id: int, user_id: int, permission: str) -> ProjectCollaborator`: Shares a project
*   **Interactions:** Used by API endpoints and interacts with database models.

### 3.6. `app/services/project_permissions.py`

*   **Description:** Manages project-level permissions and access control logic. This includes checking user permissions for various project operations.
*   **Key Functions/Methods:**
    *   `check_project_access(user_id: int, project_id: int, permission: str) -> bool`: Checks if a user has specific permissions
    *   `get_user_permission(user_id: int, project_id: int) -> str`: Gets the user's permission level for a project
    *   `grant_permission(project_id: int, user_id: int, permission: str) -> bool`: Grants permissions to a user
*   **Interactions:** Used by API endpoints to enforce access control.

### 3.7. `app/services/project_templates.py`

*   **Description:** Handles project template functionality, including creating projects from templates and managing template definitions.
*   **Key Functions/Methods:**
    *   `get_available_templates() -> List[ProjectTemplate]`: Lists available project templates
    *   `create_project_from_template(template_id: int, project_data: ProjectCreate) -> Project`: Creates a project from a template
    *   `save_project_as_template(project_id: int, template_data: TemplateCreate) -> ProjectTemplate`: Saves a project as a template
*   **Interactions:** Used by project creation endpoints and template management.

### 3.8. `app/core/config.py`

*   **Description:** Manages configuration settings for the Project Service, including database connections, pagination settings, and business rules.
*   **Key Settings:**
    *   Database connection strings
    *   Default pagination limits
    *   Project sharing and collaboration settings
    *   Template management configurations
*   **Interactions:** Used by all other components to access configuration settings.

## 4. Interaction with Other Modules

*   **User Service:** Validates user authentication and retrieves user information for project ownership and collaboration.
*   **Design Service:** Projects contain designs, so this service coordinates with the Design Service for design management within projects.
*   **API Gateway:** The gateway routes project-related requests to this service.
*   **Frontend:** The primary client for project management operations and project organization features.

## 5. Design Considerations

*   **Scalability:** Designed to handle a large number of projects and users with efficient database queries and indexing.
*   **Performance:** Optimized for fast project listing and retrieval operations with proper caching strategies.
*   **Collaboration:** Supports real-time collaboration features and conflict resolution for shared projects.
*   **Data Integrity:** Ensures referential integrity between projects, users, and designs.
*   **Flexibility:** Designed to accommodate future features like project versioning and advanced collaboration tools.

## 6. Verification

*   **Unit Tests:** Test individual CRUD operations, permission checking, and template functionality.
*   **Integration Tests:** Test API endpoints with database interactions and cross-service communication.
*   **Permission Tests:** Verify that access control and sharing mechanisms work correctly.
*   **Performance Tests:** Ensure project operations meet performance requirements under load.
*   **End-to-End Tests:** Test complete project lifecycle from creation to deletion, including collaboration features.

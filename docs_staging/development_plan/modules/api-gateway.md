# Module: API Gateway

## 1. Overview

The API Gateway serves as the single entry point for all client requests to the Architech backend services. It provides a unified interface for the frontend application and external clients, handling cross-cutting concerns such as authentication, authorization, rate limiting, request routing, and response aggregation. This module is crucial for maintaining a clean separation between the frontend and the microservices architecture.

## 2. Key Responsibilities

*   **Request Routing:** Routes incoming requests to the appropriate backend microservice based on URL patterns and request characteristics.
*   **Authentication and Authorization:** Validates user credentials and ensures that users have the necessary permissions to access specific resources.
*   **Rate Limiting:** Protects backend services from abuse by limiting the number of requests per user or IP address within a given time window.
*   **Request/Response Transformation:** Modifies requests and responses as needed (e.g., adding headers, transforming data formats).
*   **Load Balancing:** Distributes requests among multiple instances of the same service for improved performance and availability.
*   **Monitoring and Logging:** Collects metrics and logs for all requests passing through the gateway for observability and debugging.
*   **CORS Handling:** Manages Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies to enable secure frontend-backend communication.

## 3. Core Components and Files

### 3.1. `main.go` (or `main.py`)

*   **Description:** The entry point for the API Gateway service. It initializes the gateway, sets up middleware, and starts the HTTP server.
*   **Key Functions/Methods:**
    *   `main()`: Initializes configuration, middleware, and starts the server.
    *   `setupRoutes()`: Defines the routing rules for different backend services.
*   **Interactions:** Coordinates all other components within the API Gateway.

### 3.2. `router.go`

*   **Description:** Handles the routing logic, determining which backend service should handle each incoming request based on URL patterns, HTTP methods, and other criteria.
*   **Key Functions/Methods:**
    *   `Route(request Request) (service string, path string, error)`: Determines the target service and path for a given request.
    *   `AddRoute(pattern string, service string)`: Registers a new routing rule.
*   **Interactions:** Used by the main request handler to determine request destinations.

### 3.3. `auth_middleware.go`

*   **Description:** Implements authentication and authorization middleware. It validates JWT tokens, checks user permissions, and ensures secure access to protected resources.
*   **Key Functions/Methods:**
    *   `AuthenticateRequest(request Request) (user User, error)`: Validates the authentication token and returns user information.
    *   `AuthorizeRequest(user User, resource string, action string) bool`: Checks if the user has permission to perform the requested action.
*   **Interactions:** Integrates with the User Service to validate tokens and retrieve user information.

### 3.4. `rate_limiter.go`

*   **Description:** Implements rate limiting functionality to protect backend services from excessive requests. It can limit requests per user, per IP, or globally.
*   **Key Functions/Methods:**
    *   `CheckRateLimit(identifier string) (allowed bool, remaining int, resetTime time.Time)`: Checks if a request is within the rate limit.
    *   `IncrementCounter(identifier string)`: Increments the request counter for a given identifier.
*   **Interactions:** May use Redis for distributed rate limiting across multiple gateway instances.

### 3.5. `proxy.go`

*   **Description:** Handles the actual proxying of requests to backend services. It forwards requests, waits for responses, and returns them to the client.
*   **Key Functions/Methods:**
    *   `ProxyRequest(request Request, targetService string) (response Response, error)`: Forwards a request to the specified service and returns the response.
*   **Interactions:** Communicates with all backend microservices (User Service, Project Service, Design Service, etc.).

### 3.6. `middleware.go`

*   **Description:** Contains various middleware functions for cross-cutting concerns such as logging, CORS, request/response transformation, and error handling.
*   **Key Functions/Methods:**
    *   `LoggingMiddleware()`: Logs all incoming requests and outgoing responses.
    *   `CORSMiddleware()`: Handles CORS headers for cross-origin requests.
    *   `ErrorHandlingMiddleware()`: Provides consistent error responses and handles panics.
*   **Interactions:** Applied to all requests passing through the gateway.

### 3.7. `config.go`

*   **Description:** Manages configuration settings for the API Gateway, including service endpoints, authentication settings, rate limiting rules, and other operational parameters.
*   **Key Functions/Methods:**
    *   `LoadConfig()`: Loads configuration from environment variables, configuration files, or external sources.
*   **Interactions:** Used by all other components to access configuration settings.

## 4. Interaction with Other Modules

*   **Frontend:** The primary client of the API Gateway. All frontend requests are routed through the gateway.
*   **User Service:** The gateway authenticates users by validating tokens with the User Service.
*   **Project Service, Design Service, Simulation Orchestration Service, Observability Data Service, AI Service:** The gateway routes requests to these services based on URL patterns.
*   **Notification Service:** May receive requests for sending notifications to users.

## 5. Design Considerations

*   **Performance:** The gateway is a critical path component and must be optimized for low latency and high throughput.
*   **Scalability:** Should be designed to scale horizontally by running multiple instances behind a load balancer.
*   **Security:** Must implement robust authentication, authorization, and input validation to protect backend services.
*   **Reliability:** Should include circuit breaker patterns and graceful degradation to handle backend service failures.
*   **Observability:** Must provide comprehensive logging and metrics for monitoring and debugging.

## 6. Verification

*   **Unit Tests:** Test individual middleware components, routing logic, and authentication/authorization functions.
*   **Integration Tests:** Test the gateway's interaction with backend services, including authentication flows and request routing.
*   **Load Tests:** Verify that the gateway can handle expected traffic loads without performance degradation.
*   **Security Tests:** Test authentication, authorization, rate limiting, and input validation mechanisms.
*   **End-to-End Tests:** Test complete user flows through the gateway to ensure correct behavior.

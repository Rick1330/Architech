# Module: User Service

## 1. Overview

The User Service is responsible for managing user accounts, authentication, and authorization within the Architech platform. It provides a secure foundation for user management, including registration, login, profile management, and access control. This service is fundamental to ensuring that only authorized users can access the platform and that their data is properly protected.

## 2. Key Responsibilities

*   **User Registration:** Handles new user account creation with proper validation and security measures.
*   **Authentication:** Validates user credentials and issues secure authentication tokens (e.g., JWT).
*   **Authorization:** Manages user permissions and access control for different platform features.
*   **Profile Management:** Allows users to view and update their profile information.
*   **Password Management:** Provides secure password hashing, validation, and reset functionality.
*   **Session Management:** Tracks user sessions and provides mechanisms for logout and session invalidation.

## 3. Core Components and Files

### 3.1. `main.py`

*   **Description:** The FastAPI application entry point for the User Service. It initializes the application, sets up middleware, and defines the main application instance.
*   **Key Functions/Methods:**
    *   Application initialization and configuration
    *   Middleware setup (CORS, logging, error handling)
    *   Database connection initialization
*   **Interactions:** Coordinates all other components within the User Service.

### 3.2. `app/api/v1/endpoints/users.py`

*   **Description:** Defines the RESTful API endpoints for user-related operations. This includes endpoints for registration, login, profile management, and user administration.
*   **Key Endpoints:**
    *   `POST /users/register`: Creates a new user account
    *   `POST /users/login`: Authenticates a user and returns a token
    *   `GET /users/me`: Returns the current user's profile
    *   `PUT /users/me`: Updates the current user's profile
    *   `POST /users/logout`: Invalidates the user's session
    *   `POST /users/reset-password`: Initiates password reset process
*   **Interactions:** Uses CRUD operations from `app/crud/user.py` and schemas from `app/schemas/user.py`.

### 3.3. `app/db/models.py`

*   **Description:** Defines the SQLAlchemy ORM models for user-related database entities. This includes the User model and any related entities such as user sessions or permissions.
*   **Key Models:**
    *   `User`: Core user entity with fields like id, email, hashed_password, created_at, updated_at, is_active
    *   `UserSession`: Tracks active user sessions for security and logout functionality
*   **Interactions:** Used by CRUD operations and database migrations.

### 3.4. `app/schemas/user.py`

*   **Description:** Defines Pydantic schemas for request and response validation. These schemas ensure data integrity and provide clear API contracts.
*   **Key Schemas:**
    *   `UserCreate`: Schema for user registration requests
    *   `UserLogin`: Schema for login requests
    *   `UserResponse`: Schema for user data responses
    *   `UserUpdate`: Schema for profile update requests
    *   `Token`: Schema for authentication token responses
*   **Interactions:** Used by API endpoints for request validation and response serialization.

### 3.5. `app/crud/user.py`

*   **Description:** Contains Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations for user entities. This layer abstracts database operations and provides a clean interface for user data manipulation.
*   **Key Functions/Methods:**
    *   `create_user(db: Session, user: UserCreate) -> User`: Creates a new user
    *   `get_user_by_email(db: Session, email: str) -> User`: Retrieves a user by email
    *   `get_user_by_id(db: Session, user_id: int) -> User`: Retrieves a user by ID
    *   `update_user(db: Session, user_id: int, user_update: UserUpdate) -> User`: Updates user information
    *   `authenticate_user(db: Session, email: str, password: str) -> User`: Validates user credentials
*   **Interactions:** Used by API endpoints and interacts with database models.

### 3.6. `app/security/password.py`

*   **Description:** Provides secure password handling utilities including hashing, verification, and strength validation.
*   **Key Functions/Methods:**
    *   `hash_password(password: str) -> str`: Securely hashes a password using bcrypt
    *   `verify_password(password: str, hashed_password: str) -> bool`: Verifies a password against its hash
    *   `validate_password_strength(password: str) -> bool`: Checks password complexity requirements
*   **Interactions:** Used by CRUD operations and authentication endpoints.

### 3.7. `app/security/jwt.py`

*   **Description:** Handles JWT token creation, validation, and management for user authentication.
*   **Key Functions/Methods:**
    *   `create_access_token(data: dict) -> str`: Creates a JWT access token
    *   `verify_token(token: str) -> dict`: Validates and decodes a JWT token
    *   `get_current_user(token: str) -> User`: Retrieves user information from a valid token
*   **Interactions:** Used by authentication endpoints and middleware.

### 3.8. `app/core/config.py`

*   **Description:** Manages configuration settings for the User Service, including database connections, JWT settings, and security parameters.
*   **Key Settings:**
    *   Database connection strings
    *   JWT secret key and expiration settings
    *   Password complexity requirements
    *   Rate limiting configurations
*   **Interactions:** Used by all other components to access configuration settings.

## 4. Interaction with Other Modules

*   **API Gateway:** The gateway routes user-related requests to this service and validates authentication tokens.
*   **Project Service:** May query the User Service to validate user ownership of projects.
*   **Design Service:** May query the User Service to validate user permissions for design access.
*   **Frontend:** The primary client for user authentication and profile management operations.

## 5. Design Considerations

*   **Security:** Implements industry-standard security practices including password hashing, JWT tokens, and input validation.
*   **Scalability:** Designed to handle a large number of concurrent users with efficient database queries and caching.
*   **Privacy:** Ensures user data is properly protected and complies with privacy regulations.
*   **Performance:** Optimized for fast authentication and user lookup operations.
*   **Reliability:** Includes proper error handling and graceful degradation for database failures.

## 6. Verification

*   **Unit Tests:** Test individual functions for password hashing, JWT operations, and CRUD functions.
*   **Integration Tests:** Test API endpoints with database interactions and authentication flows.
*   **Security Tests:** Verify password security, token validation, and protection against common attacks.
*   **Performance Tests:** Ensure authentication operations meet performance requirements.
*   **End-to-End Tests:** Test complete user registration and login flows.

# QA Strategy: Architech

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Quality Assurance (QA) strategy for the Architech project. A robust QA strategy is essential to ensure the delivery of a high-quality, reliable, and performant product. This strategy integrates various testing methodologies, automation, and continuous feedback loops throughout the development lifecycle, leveraging both human expertise and AI capabilities.

## 2. Quality Principles

Our QA efforts are guided by the following principles:

*   **Quality is Everyone's Responsibility:** Quality is not solely the domain of the QA team but is embedded in every stage of development, from design to deployment.
*   **Shift Left:** Testing activities are initiated as early as possible in the development lifecycle to identify and address defects proactively, reducing the cost and effort of fixes.
*   **Automation First:** Prioritize test automation to enable rapid feedback, increase test coverage, and support continuous integration and delivery.
*   **Risk-Based Testing:** Focus testing efforts on areas of higher risk, complexity, or business criticality.
*   **Continuous Improvement:** Regularly review and refine the QA processes, tools, and strategies based on feedback, metrics, and lessons learned.
*   **Observability-Driven Testing:** Leverage the platform's inherent observability features (logs, metrics, traces) to gain deeper insights during testing and debugging.

## 3. Testing Levels and Types

Architech will employ a multi-layered testing approach, covering various aspects of the system.

### 3.1. Unit Testing

*   **Purpose:** To verify the correctness of individual functions, methods, or small code units in isolation.
*   **Scope:** Each microservice, core simulation engine components, utility functions, and UI components.
*   **Responsibility:** Primarily developers (human and Cursor).
*   **Tools:** Jest (Frontend), Pytest (Python Backend), Go testing framework (Go Simulation Engine).
*   **Coverage Goal:** Aim for 90%+ code coverage on critical business logic and core simulation engine components.
*   **Integration:** Integrated into the CI pipeline; unit tests run on every commit.

### 3.2. Integration Testing

*   **Purpose:** To verify the interactions and data flow between different modules, services, or external dependencies (e.g., database, message queue).
*   **Scope:** API endpoints, service-to-service communication, database interactions, message queue producers/consumers.
*   **Responsibility:** Developers (human and Cursor), QA Engineers.
*   **Tools:** Pytest, Go testing framework, Supertest (for API testing), Docker-Compose for setting up test environments.
*   **Integration:** Run as part of the CI pipeline after unit tests.

### 3.3. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

*   **Purpose:** To simulate real user scenarios and validate the entire application flow from the user interface to the backend services and databases.
*   **Scope:** Key user journeys (e.g., user registration, project creation, design, simulation execution, result viewing).
*   **Responsibility:** QA Engineers (human and Cursor).
*   **Tools:** Cypress, Playwright (for UI automation), custom scripts for backend E2E flows.
*   **Integration:** Run on dedicated staging environments, triggered by successful merges to `main` or on a schedule.

### 3.4. Performance Testing

*   **Purpose:** To assess the system's responsiveness, stability, scalability, and resource utilization under various load conditions.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Load Testing:** Simulate expected user load to verify performance under normal conditions.
    *   **Stress Testing:** Push the system beyond its normal operating limits to determine its breaking point and how it behaves under extreme load.
    *   **Scalability Testing:** Determine how the system scales by increasing the load and resources.
*   **Scope:** Backend APIs, Simulation Orchestration Service, Simulation Engine.
*   **Responsibility:** QA Engineers, DevOps Engineers.
*   **Tools:** JMeter, Locust, k6.
*   **Integration:** Conducted at key milestones and before major releases.

### 3.5. Security Testing

*   **Purpose:** To identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the application and infrastructure that could be exploited by attackers.
*   **Types:**
    *   **Static Application Security Testing (SAST):** Code analysis without execution (part of CI).
    *   **Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST):** Testing the running application from the outside.
    *   **Penetration Testing:** Manual and automated attempts to exploit vulnerabilities.
*   **Scope:** All application components, APIs, and infrastructure.
*   **Responsibility:** Security Engineers, QA Engineers, Manus (for SAST/DAST integration).
*   **Tools:** SonarQube, OWASP ZAP, Nessus.
*   **Integration:** SAST in CI, DAST in staging/pre-prod, penetration tests periodically.

### 3.6. Usability Testing

*   **Purpose:** To evaluate the ease of use and user-friendliness of the Architech UI/UX.
*   **Scope:** Frontend application.
*   **Responsibility:** UI/UX Designers, Product Managers, QA Engineers.
*   **Methodology:** User interviews, A/B testing, heuristic evaluation.
*   **Integration:** Conducted iteratively throughout frontend development.

### 3.7. Chaos Engineering (Simulated)

*   **Purpose:** To proactively identify weaknesses and build confidence in the system's resilience by injecting controlled failures in a simulated environment.
*   **Scope:** Distributed system designs within the Architech simulation environment.
*   **Responsibility:** QA Engineers, DevOps Engineers, Users (for their own designs).
*   **Tools:** Architech's built-in Fault Injection capabilities.
*   **Integration:** Used during the design and validation phases, and as part of the E2E testing strategy.

## 4. Quality Gates

Quality gates are checkpoints in the development process where specific criteria must be met before proceeding to the next stage.

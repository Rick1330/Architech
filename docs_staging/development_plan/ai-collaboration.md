# AI Collaboration Strategy: Architech Development

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the strategy for effective collaboration between human development teams and AI agents (Manus, Cursor, Lovable, MGX.dev) in the development of Architech. The goal is to leverage the strengths of both human creativity and AI efficiency to accelerate development, enhance code quality, and streamline workflows.

## 2. Core Principles of AI-Human Collaboration

*   **AI as a Force Multiplier:** AI agents are viewed as powerful tools that augment human capabilities, automating repetitive tasks, generating boilerplate code, assisting with debugging, and providing intelligent insights. They are not intended to replace human developers but to empower them.
*   **Human Oversight and Direction:** Human developers retain ultimate responsibility for architectural decisions, complex problem-solving, strategic direction, and critical code reviews. AI agents operate under human guidance and within defined constraints.
*   **Clear Assignment of Responsibilities:** Each AI agent and human role will have clearly defined responsibilities and areas of expertise to minimize overlap and maximize efficiency.
*   **Iterative Feedback Loops:** Continuous feedback mechanisms will be established between human developers and AI agents to refine AI performance, correct errors, and improve collaboration patterns.
*   **Transparency and Explainability:** AI agents will strive to provide clear explanations for their actions, suggestions, and generated code to foster trust and enable human understanding and learning.

## 3. Roles and Responsibilities of AI Agents

# Architech: Deep Development Plan

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a comprehensive, code-specific development plan for Architech, a systems design simulation studio. This plan is designed to guide a coordinated effort between human development teams and AI agents (Manus, Cursor, Lovable, MGX.dev) to build a robust, scalable, and high-quality product. It breaks down the entire project into manageable phases, defines exact files and modules, assigns responsibilities, and specifies testing and quality assurance criteria.

## 2. Project Vision and Goals

**Vision:** To empower engineers and architects to design, simulate, and validate complex distributed systems with unprecedented confidence and efficiency, transforming architectural design from a static exercise into a dynamic, interactive, and intelligent process.

**Goals:**
*   Develop a highly interactive visual design canvas for intuitive system modeling.
*   Implement a high-fidelity discrete-event simulation engine capable of modeling complex distributed system behaviors (latency, throughput, failures).
*   Integrate an AI-powered assistant for real-time design feedback, anti-pattern detection, and optimization suggestions.
*   Provide comprehensive observability features (logs, metrics, traces) within the simulation environment.
*   Ensure a scalable, secure, and maintainable microservices architecture.
*   Establish a robust CI/CD pipeline for continuous delivery and quality assurance.

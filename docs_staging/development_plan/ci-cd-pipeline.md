# CI/CD Pipeline: Architech

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD) pipeline for Architech. A robust CI/CD pipeline is essential for automating the build, test, and deployment processes, enabling rapid, reliable, and consistent delivery of new features and bug fixes. Our CI/CD strategy is designed to support our microservices architecture and promote a culture of DevOps.

## 2. CI/CD Principles

*   **Automation:** Automate every step of the build, test, and deployment process to reduce manual effort and minimize human error.
*   **Consistency:** Ensure that every code change goes through the same automated process, resulting in consistent and predictable builds.
*   **Early Feedback:** Provide developers with fast feedback on their code changes by running automated tests early and often.
*   **Reliability:** Build a reliable and resilient pipeline that can be trusted to deploy code to production safely.
*   **Security:** Integrate security scanning and testing into the pipeline to identify and address vulnerabilities before they reach production.

## 3. CI/CD Tools

*   **Version Control System (VCS):** Git (hosted on GitHub).
*   **CI/CD Platform:** GitHub Actions (or a similar platform like GitLab CI/CD, Jenkins).
*   **Containerization:** Docker.
*   **Container Registry:** Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry, or a cloud provider's registry (e.g., Amazon ECR, Google Container Registry).
*   **Container Orchestration:** Kubernetes.
*   **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Terraform, Helm.

## 4. CI Pipeline

The CI pipeline is triggered on every `git push` to a feature branch or a pull request to the `main` branch.

### 4.1. Pipeline Stages

1.  **Code Checkout:** The pipeline checks out the latest code from the Git repository.
2.  **Dependency Installation:** It installs all necessary dependencies for the specific service being built (e.g., `npm install` for frontend, `pip install` for backend).
3.  **Linting:** It runs static code analysis and linting tools to enforce code quality and style standards.
4.  **Unit & Integration Testing:** It runs a comprehensive suite of unit and integration tests to verify the correctness of the code.
5.  **Security Scanning (SAST):** It runs Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools to scan the code for potential security vulnerabilities.
6.  **Build Artifacts:**
    *   For backend services, it builds a Docker image.
    *   For the frontend, it builds a production-ready static bundle.
7.  **Push to Container Registry:** The newly built Docker image is tagged and pushed to the container registry.
8.  **Notification:** The pipeline notifies developers of the build status (e.g., via Slack, email).

### 4.2. Pull Request Workflow

*   When a developer opens a pull request, the CI pipeline runs all the above stages.
*   The pull request can only be merged if all stages pass successfully.
*   A code review from at least one other team member is required before merging.

## 5. CD Pipeline

The CD pipeline is triggered on every successful merge to the `main` branch.

### 5.1. Environments

We will use a multi-environment deployment strategy:

*   **Development (Dev):** A shared environment for developers to test their changes in an integrated setting. Deployed automatically on every merge to the `main` branch.
*   **Staging:** A production-like environment for end-to-end testing, quality assurance (QA), and user acceptance testing (UAT). Deployed manually or on a schedule.
*   **Production (Prod):** The live environment for end users. Deployed manually with a controlled rollout strategy.

### 5.2. Deployment Strategy

We will use a progressive deployment strategy to minimize risk and ensure a smooth rollout.

*   **Canary Deployments:** A new version of a service is initially rolled out to a small subset of users. We monitor key metrics (error rates, latency) to ensure the new version is stable before gradually rolling it out to all users.
*   **Blue-Green Deployments:** Two identical production environments (Blue and Green) are maintained. The new version is deployed to the inactive environment (e.g., Green). Once it is fully tested, traffic is switched from the old environment (Blue) to the new one. This allows for instant rollback if any issues are detected.

### 5.3. Pipeline Stages

1.  **Trigger:** The pipeline is triggered by a successful merge to the `main` branch (for Dev) or a manual trigger (for Staging/Prod).
2.  **Deploy to Environment:**
    *   The pipeline uses Helm charts and Terraform to provision and configure the necessary infrastructure and deploy the new version of the service to the target Kubernetes cluster.
    *   It updates the Kubernetes deployment with the new Docker image tag.
3.  **Smoke Testing:** After deployment, a set of automated smoke tests are run to verify that the service is running and responding correctly.
4.  **End-to-End Testing (for Staging):** A comprehensive suite of end-to-end tests is run against the Staging environment to validate the functionality of the entire application.
5.  **Manual Approval (for Prod):** A manual approval step is required before deploying to the Production environment.
6.  **Promote to Production:** The new version is deployed to Production using a canary or blue-green strategy.
7.  **Monitoring and Rollback:** The pipeline monitors key metrics after deployment. If any anomalies are detected, it can automatically roll back to the previous version.

## 6. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

*   **Terraform:** We will use Terraform to manage our cloud infrastructure (e.g., Kubernetes clusters, databases, message queues) as code. This ensures that our infrastructure is reproducible, version-controlled, and can be easily provisioned and updated.
*   **Helm:** We will use Helm charts to define, install, and upgrade our applications on Kubernetes. This simplifies the management of complex Kubernetes deployments.

By implementing this robust CI/CD pipeline, we will be able to deliver high-quality software to our users quickly and reliably, while maintaining a high degree of confidence in the stability and security of our platform.

# FAQ: Architech

## 1. General Questions

### Q: What is Architech?

A: Architech is a web-based, visual simulation studio designed for engineers to design, simulate, and validate distributed systems. It allows you to drag-and-drop components, connect them, and simulate realistic system behaviors like request flow, latency, and failure propagation. It also provides AI-guided feedback and integrated observability.

### Q: Who is Architech for?

A: Architech is primarily for senior software engineers, system architects, DevOps engineers, and engineering managers working on complex distributed systems. It's also a valuable tool for technical interviewers, candidates preparing for systems design interviews, and educators/students in advanced computer science courses.

### Q: What makes Architech different from other diagramming tools?

A: Unlike static diagramming tools, Architech brings your designs to life with real-time simulation. It also integrates AI-guided feedback, advanced fault injection, and comprehensive observability directly into the design environment, allowing for proactive validation and optimization of your architectures.

### Q: Is Architech open source?

A: The long-term vision for Architech includes an open-source core simulation engine, with a commercial SaaS offering for advanced features and enterprise support. Please refer to the `roadmap.md` for more details.

### Q: What technologies is Architech built with?

A: Architech is built with a modern microservices architecture. The frontend is likely built with React/Vue/Angular, the backend services with frameworks like FastAPI (Python) or Spring Boot (Java), and the high-performance simulation engine potentially in Go or Rust. It uses various databases (PostgreSQL, time-series DBs, document DBs) and message queues (e.g., Kafka).

## 2. Simulation Questions

### Q: How realistic are the simulations?

A: Architech aims for high-fidelity simulations by allowing granular configuration of component properties (e.g., processing times, latencies, capacities) and modeling various real-world behaviors like queueing, backpressure, and network effects. While it's a simulation, it's designed to provide insights that closely mirror real-world distributed system behavior.

### Q: Can I simulate failures in my system?

A: Yes, Architech features advanced fault injection capabilities. You can simulate component crashes, network partitions, latency spikes, resource exhaustion, and more, to test the resilience of your system design.

### Q: How does Architech provide observability during simulations?

A: Architech integrates the three pillars of observability: logs, metrics, and traces. During a simulation, you can view real-time event logs from each component, monitor key performance metrics (RPS, latency, error rates), and analyze end-to-end request traces to understand data flow and bottlenecks.

### Q: Can I use my own custom components in the simulation?

A: In later phases of development, Architech will support defining and importing custom components with user-defined behaviors, allowing for greater flexibility and extensibility.

## 3. AI Assistant Questions

### Q: How does the AI assistant work?

A: The AI assistant analyzes your system design and simulation results to provide intelligent feedback. It can detect common distributed system anti-patterns, identify performance bottlenecks, suggest resilience patterns, and recommend architectural improvements. It acts as a co-pilot to guide you towards better designs.

### Q: Is the AI assistant always active?

A: The AI assistant can be configured to provide real-time feedback or generate reports on demand. Its behavior and level of intervention can be customized based on user preferences.

### Q: What kind of feedback does the AI provide?

A: The AI provides actionable feedback, such as: "This database appears to be a single point of failure; consider adding replicas for high availability," or "The current message queue capacity is insufficient for the simulated load, leading to message loss."

## 4. Collaboration and Sharing

### Q: Can I collaborate with my team on designs?

A: Yes, Architech will support real-time collaboration features, allowing multiple users to work on the same design simultaneously. You can also share your designs with others for review and feedback.

### Q: Can I export my designs?

A: In future phases, Architech will support importing and exporting designs to various formats, including integration with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform and CloudFormation.

## 5. Troubleshooting

### Q: My simulation is running very slowly. What should I do?

A: Check the complexity of your design and the configured request rate. Very large designs or extremely high request rates can be computationally intensive. Consider simplifying your design for initial simulations or reducing the request rate. Also, ensure your local development environment meets the recommended specifications.

### Q: I'm seeing unexpected behavior in my simulation. How can I debug it?

A: Utilize the integrated observability tools: review the event logs for detailed messages, check component-level metrics for anomalies (e.g., high latency, full queues), and analyze request traces to understand the exact path and timing of requests through your system.

### Q: Where can I report a bug or suggest a feature?

A: Please refer to the `CONTRIBUTING.md` file in the project repository for guidelines on reporting bugs and suggesting enhancements.

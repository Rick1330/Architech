# Simulation Engine Notes: Architech

## 1. Introduction

This document contains technical notes and design considerations for the Architech simulation engine. As the computational core of the platform, the engine's design is critical for achieving high performance, accuracy, and extensibility. These notes are intended for developers working on or interacting with the simulation engine.

## 2. Core Architecture: Discrete Event Simulation (DES)

*   **Paradigm:** The engine is built on a Discrete Event Simulation (DES) model. This is a natural fit for distributed systems, where state changes occur at discrete points in time (e.g., request arrival, processing completion).
*   **Event Queue:** The heart of the DES is the event queue, which stores future events ordered by their timestamp. We will use a priority queue (min-heap) for efficient O(log n) insertion and O(1) extraction of the next event.
*   **Simulation Clock:** The simulation clock is logical and advances non-uniformly, jumping from one event's timestamp to the next. This is far more efficient than a time-stepped simulation for systems with bursty or irregular event patterns.

## 3. Key Data Structures

*   **`Event`:** A struct or class representing an event. It contains:
    *   `timestamp`: The time at which the event occurs.
    *   `type`: The type of event (e.g., `RequestArrival`, `ServiceProcessingComplete`).
    *   `data`: A payload containing event-specific information (e.g., the request object, the target component).
*   **`Component`:** A base class or interface for all simulated components. It defines common methods like `handle_event(event)` and properties like `id`, `name`, `type`.
*   **`Request`:** A struct or class representing a request flowing through the system. It carries a unique `trace_id`, `span_id`, and other metadata.

## 4. Performance Considerations

*   **Language Choice:** The simulation engine should be implemented in a high-performance language. Go and Rust are strong contenders due to their concurrency support and memory safety. A performant Python framework (e.g., using Cython or PyPy) could also be considered for faster prototyping, but may require more optimization later.
*   **Memory Management:** With potentially millions of events and requests in a large simulation, efficient memory management is crucial. We should use object pooling for frequently created and destroyed objects like `Event` and `Request` to reduce garbage collection overhead.
*   **Concurrency and Parallelism:** While the core DES loop is inherently sequential, there are opportunities for parallelism:
    *   **Parallel Event Processing:** If multiple events have the same timestamp, they can potentially be processed in parallel, provided they do not affect the same components.
    *   **Distributed Simulation:** For very large simulations, we can explore partitioning the system graph and distributing the simulation across multiple nodes. This requires careful handling of cross-node event communication and time synchronization.

## 5. Extensibility

*   **Component Model:** The component model should be highly extensible. We will use a plugin-based architecture where new component types can be added without modifying the core engine. Each component will have its own state machine and event handlers.
*   **Scripting for Custom Behaviors:** To allow for maximum flexibility, we will integrate a scripting engine (e.g., Lua, Python, JavaScript) that allows users to define custom behaviors for their components. This will enable modeling of complex application logic.

## 6. Simulation Fidelity and Realism

*   **Stochastic Modeling:** To make simulations more realistic, we will use stochastic distributions for various parameters:
    *   **Request Arrival:** Use a Poisson process to model random request arrivals.
    *   **Processing Times:** Use distributions like Normal or Exponential to model variations in service processing times.
*   **Network Modeling:** The network model will evolve from a simple global latency parameter to a more complex model that includes:
    *   Per-link latency and bandwidth.
    *   Packet loss and reordering.
    *   Network topologies.
*   **Resource Contention:** The engine will model contention for shared resources like CPU, memory, and database connection pools. This is crucial for identifying performance bottlenecks under load.

## 7. State Management and Snapshots

*   **Simulation State:** The entire state of the simulation (event queue, component states, etc.) needs to be managed carefully.
*   **Snapshots and Replay:** We will implement functionality to take snapshots of the simulation state at any point in time. This will allow users to:
    *   Save and restore simulations.
    *   Replay simulations from a specific point for debugging.
    *   Perform "what-if" analysis by branching from a snapshot and changing parameters.

## 8. Integration with Other Services

*   **API:** The simulation engine will expose a clear API for the Simulation Orchestration Service to start, stop, and manage simulations.
*   **Event Emitter:** The engine will emit a stream of events (logs, metrics, traces) to a message queue (e.g., Kafka) for consumption by the Observability Data Service and the AI Assistant.

## 9. Testing and Validation

*   **Unit Tests:** Each component model and engine subsystem will have extensive unit tests.
*   **Integration Tests:** We will have integration tests for complex interaction scenarios.
*   **Validation against Real Systems:** Where possible, we will validate the simulation engine's output against data from real-world systems to ensure its accuracy.
*   **Deterministic vs. Stochastic Modes:** The engine will support both deterministic (for reproducible tests) and stochastic (for realistic simulations) modes.

These notes provide a high-level overview of the design considerations for the Architech simulation engine. The actual implementation will involve many more detailed decisions, but these principles will guide us in building a powerful, performant, and extensible core for our platform.

# Visual Design System: Architech

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the foundational principles and components of the Architech Visual Design System. A consistent and well-defined design system is crucial for ensuring a cohesive user experience, accelerating development, and maintaining brand identity across the platform. This system will serve as a single source of truth for all visual and interactive elements.

## 2. Design Principles

Our visual design is guided by the following principles:

*   **Clarity:** Information should be presented clearly and unambiguously, minimizing cognitive load for users.
*   **Simplicity:** Designs should be clean and uncluttered, focusing on essential elements.
*   **Consistency:** UI elements, interactions, and visual styles should be consistent across the entire application.
*   **Efficiency:** The design should enable users to complete tasks quickly and effectively.
*   **Feedback:** The system should provide clear and immediate feedback to user actions and system states.
*   **Scalability:** The design system should be flexible enough to accommodate new features and complex visualizations without breaking consistency.

## 3. Brand Identity

### 3.1. Logo

*   **Concept:** The Architech logo will combine elements of architecture, technology, and connectivity. It should convey precision, innovation, and reliability.
*   **Usage:** The logo will be used across the application, marketing materials, and documentation.

### 3.2. Color Palette

Our color palette is designed to be modern, professional, and visually appealing, while also providing clear distinctions for different states and information types.

*   **Primary Colors:**
    *   **Brand Blue:** `#007BFF` (RGB: 0, 123, 255) - Used for primary actions, branding, and key interactive elements.
    *   **Dark Gray:** `#343A40` (RGB: 52, 58, 64) - Used for primary text, backgrounds, and structural elements.
*   **Secondary Colors:**
    *   **Light Gray:** `#F8F9FA` (RGB: 248, 249, 250) - Used for backgrounds, borders, and subtle UI elements.
    *   **Accent Green:** `#28A745` (RGB: 40, 167, 69) - Used for success states, positive indicators, and highlights.
    *   **Accent Red:** `#DC3545` (RGB: 220, 53, 69) - Used for error states, warnings, and critical actions.
    *   **Accent Orange:** `#FFC107` (RGB: 255, 193, 7) - Used for warnings, pending states, and informational alerts.
*   **Neutral Colors:**
    *   **White:** `#FFFFFF`
    *   **Black:** `#000000`

### 3.3. Typography

We will use a clean, readable sans-serif typeface for all text elements.

*   **Primary Font:** `Inter` (or similar open-source alternative like `Roboto`, `Open Sans`)
*   **Headings:** Bold, larger sizes for hierarchy (e.g., `H1: 2.5rem`, `H2: 2rem`, `H3: 1.75rem`)
*   **Body Text:** Regular weight, comfortable reading size (e.g., `1rem` or `16px`)
*   **Code/Monospace:** `Fira Code` or `JetBrains Mono` for code blocks and technical text.

## 4. UI Components

This section defines the standard UI components that will be used throughout the application.

### 4.1. Buttons

*   **Primary Button:** Brand Blue background, white text. Used for main actions.
*   **Secondary Button:** Light Gray background, Dark Gray text. Used for secondary actions.
*   **Outline Button:** Transparent background, Brand Blue border and text. Used for less prominent actions.
*   **States:** Hover, Active, Disabled.

### 4.2. Forms

*   **Input Fields:** Standard text inputs, text areas, and select dropdowns with clear labels and validation states (success, error).
*   **Checkboxes & Radio Buttons:** Standard styling for selection controls.
*   **Sliders:** For numerical input ranges.

### 4.3. Navigation

*   **Top Navigation Bar:** For global navigation (e.g., Dashboard, Projects, Settings).
*   **Side Navigation Bar:** For context-specific navigation within a project or section.
*   **Breadcrumbs:** To indicate the user's current location within the application hierarchy.

### 4.4. Data Display

*   **Tables:** Clean, readable tables for displaying structured data.
*   **Cards:** Used to group related information or actions.
*   **Badges/Tags:** Small, colored labels for status indicators or categorization.

### 4.5. Icons

We will use a consistent icon set (e.g., Font Awesome, Material Icons) for clarity and visual appeal. Icons will be used to represent actions, component types, and status indicators.

## 5. Visual Design of Simulation Components

### 5.1. Component Shapes and Colors

*   **Services:** Rectangular shape, Brand Blue border, light fill.
*   **Databases:** Cylindrical shape, Dark Gray border, light fill.
*   **Message Queues:** Trapezoidal shape, Accent Orange border, light fill.
*   **Load Balancers:** Diamond shape, Brand Blue border, light fill.
*   **Caches:** Hexagonal shape, Brand Blue border, light fill.
*   **Network Links (Connections):** Thin lines with arrows indicating direction. Color changes to Accent Red on failure, Accent Green on high throughput.

### 5.2. State Indicators

*   **Healthy:** Green border/glow.
*   **Degraded:** Orange border/glow.
*   **Unhealthy/Failed:** Red border/glow.
*   **Processing/Active:** Pulsating animation or subtle glow.

### 5.3. Observability Visualizations

*   **Metrics Charts:** Line graphs for latency and throughput, bar charts for request counts, pie charts for error distribution. Consistent color coding for different metrics.
*   **Trace Visualization:** Interactive graph or timeline view showing request paths and latency at each hop.
*   **Log Viewer:** Monospace font, color-coded log levels (e.g., red for ERROR, orange for WARN, blue for INFO).

## 6. Accessibility

We are committed to making Architech accessible to all users. Our design system will adhere to WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) 2.1 AA standards, including:

*   **Color Contrast:** Ensuring sufficient contrast between text and background colors.
*   **Keyboard Navigation:** All interactive elements will be navigable via keyboard.
*   **ARIA Attributes:** Using appropriate ARIA attributes for screen readers.
*   **Focus Indicators:** Clear visual focus indicators for interactive elements.

## 7. Implementation Guidelines

*   **Component Library:** Develop a reusable component library (e.g., React components) based on this design system.
*   **Design Tokens:** Use design tokens (e.g., CSS variables) for colors, typography, spacing, etc., to ensure consistency and easy updates.
*   **Documentation:** Maintain comprehensive documentation for each component, including usage guidelines, props, and examples.

# Architecture Design: Architech

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the high-level architecture of Architech, a web-based systems design simulation studio. The architecture is designed to be modular, scalable, extensible, and maintainable, adhering to modern software engineering principles such as separation of concerns, loose coupling, and high cohesion. We aim for a robust and performant system capable of handling complex simulations and providing real-time interactive experiences.

## 2. Guiding Principles

The architectural design of Architech is guided by the following principles:

*   **Modularity:** The system is composed of independent, self-contained modules with well-defined interfaces. This promotes reusability, simplifies development, and enhances maintainability.
*   **Scalability:** The architecture is designed to scale horizontally to accommodate a growing number of users and increasingly complex simulations. This involves stateless components where possible and efficient resource management.
*   **Extensibility:** The platform should be easily extendable to support new components, simulation models, and AI capabilities without requiring significant changes to the core system.
*   **Performance:** Critical paths, especially the simulation engine, are optimized for speed and efficiency to provide a responsive user experience.
*   **Observability:** The system is designed with observability in mind, incorporating logging, metrics, and tracing to facilitate monitoring, debugging, and performance analysis.
*   **Security:** Security is a paramount concern, with measures implemented at all layers to protect user data and intellectual property.
*   **User Experience (UX):** The frontend is designed to be intuitive, responsive, and visually appealing, providing a seamless experience for complex system design.

## 3. High-Level Architecture Overview

Architech follows a microservices-oriented architecture, separating concerns into distinct, independently deployable services. This allows for flexibility in technology choices, independent scaling, and improved fault isolation. The primary components are:

*   **Frontend (Client-side Application):** A rich web application providing the visual design canvas, simulation controls, and observability dashboards.
*   **Backend Services (APIs & Business Logic):** A set of microservices handling user management, project management, design persistence, and orchestration of simulations.
*   **Simulation Engine:** The core computational component responsible for executing system simulations, modeling component behaviors, and injecting faults.
*   **AI Service:** A dedicated service for providing intelligent feedback, anti-pattern detection, and design pattern suggestions.
*   **Data Storage:** Various databases optimized for different data types (e.g., relational for user/project data, NoSQL for simulation results, graph database for architectural relationships).
*   **Message Queue/Event Bus:** Facilitates asynchronous communication between services, ensuring loose coupling and enabling event-driven architectures.

## 4. Component Breakdown

### 4.1. Frontend

*   **Technology Stack:** React/Vue/Angular (e.g., React), TypeScript, WebGL/Canvas for rendering the visual design canvas (e.g., Konva.js, PixiJS), D3.js for data visualization.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Provides the interactive drag-and-drop visual editor for system components.
    *   Manages user interactions, including component placement, connection, and property editing.
    *   Displays real-time simulation progress, logs, metrics, and traces.
    *   Handles user authentication and authorization flows (via Backend Services).
    *   Renders complex architectural diagrams and simulation results.

### 4.2. Backend Services

Implemented as a suite of microservices, potentially using a framework like Spring Boot (Java), Node.js (Express/NestJS), or FastAPI (Python). Each service will have a single, well-defined responsibility.

*   **API Gateway:** (e.g., Nginx, Kong, AWS API Gateway)
    *   Acts as the single entry point for all client requests.
    *   Handles request routing, load balancing, authentication, and rate limiting.
    *   Aggregates responses from multiple microservices.
*   **User Management Service:**
    *   Manages user accounts, authentication (e.g., OAuth2, JWT), and authorization.
    *   Stores user profiles and preferences.
*   **Project Service:**
    *   Manages project creation, retrieval, updates, and deletion.
    *   Stores project metadata and references to architectural designs.
*   **Design Service:**
    *   Manages the persistence and versioning of system designs.
    *   Stores component configurations, connections, and simulation parameters.
    *   Potentially uses a graph database to represent architectural relationships efficiently.
*   **Simulation Orchestration Service:**
    *   Receives requests to start, stop, and manage simulations.
    *   Communicates with the Simulation Engine to initiate and control simulation runs.
    *   Collects simulation results and stores them.
*   **Observability Data Service:**
    *   Ingests logs, metrics, and traces generated by the Simulation Engine.
    *   Provides APIs for querying and visualizing observability data.

### 4.3. Simulation Engine

This is the computational core of Architech, likely implemented in a high-performance language like Go or Rust, or a performant Python framework. It needs to be highly optimized for discrete-event simulation.

*   **Core Logic:** Implements the discrete-event simulation logic, advancing time based on events (e.g., request arrival, processing completion, network delay).
*   **Component Models:** Contains a library of pre-defined component models (e.g., CPU, memory, network, database, queue) with configurable behaviors and parameters.
*   **Fault Injection Module:** Responsible for introducing various failure scenarios into the simulation based on user-defined policies.
*   **Resource Management:** Simulates resource contention and utilization (CPU, memory, network bandwidth).
*   **Event Emitter:** Publishes simulation events (e.g., request processed, error occurred, metric updated) to the Message Queue/Event Bus for consumption by other services.

### 4.4. AI Service

Leverages machine learning models to provide intelligent insights. This service could be implemented using Python with frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch.

*   **Anti-pattern Detection Module:** Analyzes the system design and simulation results to identify common distributed system anti-patterns.
*   **Design Pattern Recommendation Module:** Suggests relevant design patterns based on identified problems or desired system characteristics.

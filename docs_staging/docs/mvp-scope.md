# MVP Scope: Architech

## 1. Introduction

This document defines the scope of the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for Architech. The primary goal of the MVP is to deliver a core set of features that provide significant value to our initial target audience (senior software engineers and system architects) while allowing us to gather feedback and validate our core assumptions. The MVP will focus on the essential functionalities of visual design, basic simulation, and integrated observability, laying a solid foundation for future enhancements.

## 2. Core MVP Features

The Architech MVP will include the following key features:

### 2.1. Visual Design Canvas

*   **Drag-and-Drop Interface:** Users can drag pre-defined components from a library onto a canvas.
*   **Component Library (Basic):** The MVP will include a limited set of essential components:
    *   **Generic Service:** A configurable component representing a microservice or application.
    *   **Database:** A generic database component (e.g., SQL, NoSQL).
    *   **Message Queue:** A generic message queue component.
    *   **Load Balancer:** A basic load balancer with simple routing strategies (e.g., round-robin).
    *   **Cache:** A generic caching component.
*   **Component Connectivity:** Users can draw connections between components to represent data flow and dependencies.
*   **Component Properties:** Users can configure basic properties for each component, such as:
    *   **Service:** Processing time (e.g., in milliseconds).
    *   **Database:** Read/write latency.
    *   **Queue:** Capacity and processing delay.
*   **Save/Load Designs:** Users can save their architectural designs and load them for later use.

### 2.2. Simulation Engine (Basic)

*   **Discrete-Event Simulation:** The engine will simulate the flow of requests through the designed system based on a discrete-event model.
*   **Request Generation:** Users can define a simple request generator that sends requests to a designated entry point in the system at a specified rate.
*   **Latency Simulation:** The engine will model basic latency based on component processing times and network delays (configurable as a global parameter).
*   **Queueing and Backpressure:** The simulation will model basic queueing behavior, including message delays and potential overflows if queue capacity is exceeded.
*   **No Fault Injection in MVP:** The MVP will focus on simulating the “happy path” and basic system behavior. Advanced fault injection will be a post-MVP feature.

### 2.3. Integrated Observability (Basic)

*   **Real-time Metrics:** The frontend will display basic real-time metrics for each component during the simulation, including:
    *   **Request Count:** Total number of requests processed.
    *   **Average Latency:** Average time taken to process a request.
    *   **Queue Length:** Number of messages currently in a queue.
*   **Event Log:** A simple event log will display key events occurring during the simulation (e.g., request arrival, processing start/end, queue overflow).
*   **No Tracing in MVP:** End-to-end request tracing will be a post-MVP feature.

### 2.4. User Management

*   **Basic User Authentication:** Users can sign up and log in with an email and password.
*   **Project Management:** Users can create, view, and delete their own projects (architectural designs).

## 3. Non-Goals for MVP

The following features are explicitly out of scope for the MVP to ensure a focused and timely delivery:

*   **Advanced Fault Injection:** No simulation of component failures, network partitions, or other complex failure modes.
*   **AI-Guided Feedback:** No AI-powered anti-pattern detection, design pattern suggestions, or performance optimization recommendations.
*   **Extensive Component Library:** The component library will be limited to the essential components listed above. Custom component creation will not be supported.
*   **Collaboration Features:** No real-time collaboration or sharing of designs between users.
*   **Version Control for Architectures:** No versioning, branching, or merging of designs.
*   **Integration with IaC Tools:** No import/export functionality for Terraform, CloudFormation, etc.
*   **Advanced Observability:** No end-to-end tracing, detailed performance dashboards, or complex metric analysis.
*   **Programmatic API:** No public API for programmatic interaction with the platform.

## 4. Target Audience for MVP

The MVP will primarily target **individual senior software engineers and system architects** who are looking for a tool to quickly visualize and get a basic understanding of their system designs. We will also target **candidates preparing for systems design interviews** who can use the tool to practice and demonstrate their skills.

## 5. Success Metrics for MVP

The success of the Architech MVP will be measured by:

*   **User Adoption:** Number of registered users and active projects.
*   **User Engagement:** Frequency and duration of user sessions, number of simulations run.
*   **User Feedback:** Qualitative feedback from early adopters on the value and usability of the platform.
*   **Validation of Core Assumptions:** Confirmation that users find value in the visual design and basic simulation capabilities.

By delivering a focused and high-quality MVP, we aim to build a strong foundation for Architech and gather the necessary insights to guide our future development efforts.

# Session Decisions and Activities Log

## Current Session Overview
**Date:** 2025-01-08  
**Session Goal:** Integrate lovable.dev frontend with Architech backend services  
**Phase:** Phase 4 - Frontend Integration  

## Key Decisions Made This Session

### 1. Branch Strategy Decision
**Decision:** Create `feature/frontend-evaluation-and-integration` branch from `develop` (not from `feature/phase3-simulation-engine`)  
**Rationale:** User specified to inherit from `develop` branch for better integration with latest codebase  
**Impact:** Ensures we have the most up-to-date backend services for integration  

### 2. Frontend Replacement Strategy
**Decision:** Complete removal of existing frontend directory and replacement with lovable.dev frontend  
**Rationale:** Old frontend was incomplete and causing CI/CD issues; lovable.dev frontend is fully functional with passing tests  
**Impact:** Clean slate approach eliminates legacy code conflicts  

### 3. Repository Integration Approach
**Decision:** Clone lovable.dev frontend directly into Architech monorepo structure  
**Rationale:** Maintains monorepo benefits while preserving lovable.dev's complete implementation  
**Impact:** Simplifies deployment and CI/CD while keeping all code in one repository  

## Activities Performed This Session

### Git Operations
1. ‚úÖ Cloned Architech repository to fresh sandbox
2. ‚úÖ Fetched all remote branches
3. ‚úÖ Checked out `develop` branch as base
4. ‚úÖ Created new branch `feature/frontend-evaluation-and-integration`
5. ‚úÖ Removed existing `frontend/` directory completely
6. ‚úÖ Cloned `https://github.com/Rick1330/architech-visual-forge.git` into `frontend/`
7. ‚úÖ Added all frontend files to Git staging
8. ‚úÖ Committed changes with message: "Integrate lovable.dev frontend and remove old frontend directory"
9. ‚úÖ Pushed branch to remote repository
10. ‚úÖ Set up tracking for remote branch

### Environment Setup
1. ‚úÖ Configured Git user credentials (rick1330, elishum8@gmail.com)
2. ‚úÖ Verified repository structure and file integrity
3. ‚ùå Attempted Docker Compose startup - encountered persistent `http+docker` URL scheme error

### Analysis and Documentation
1. ‚úÖ Analyzed ChatGPT suggestions for Docker issue resolution
2. ‚úÖ Attempted multiple Docker troubleshooting approaches
3. ‚úÖ Created comprehensive project context documentation
4. ‚úÖ Created detailed session activity log

## Technical Issues Encountered

### Docker Compose Error
**Issue:** `Not supported URL scheme http+docker` error when running `docker-compose up -d`  
**Attempted Solutions:**
- Set `DOCKER_HOST=unix:///var/run/docker.sock`
- Tried both `docker-compose` (v1) and `docker compose` (v2)
- Restarted Docker daemon
- Checked environment variables

**Status:** Unresolved - appears to be sandbox environmental issue  
**Impact:** Cannot start backend services locally for integration testing  
**Recommendation:** Fresh sandbox environment likely needed  

## Files Created/Modified This Session

### New Files Created
1. `/home/ubuntu/Architech/project_context_and_history.md` - Comprehensive project documentation
2. `/home/ubuntu/Architech/session_decisions_and_activities.md` - This activity log
3. Entire `/home/ubuntu/Architech/frontend/` directory - lovable.dev frontend integration

### Files Modified
- Git repository state (new branch, commits, remote tracking)

## Integration Status

### Completed
- ‚úÖ Frontend code successfully integrated into monorepo
- ‚úÖ Git workflow established for new branch
- ‚úÖ Repository structure verified

### Pending (Blocked by Docker Issue)
- üîÑ Backend services startup
- üîÑ Frontend dependency installation
- üîÑ Environment variable configuration
- üîÑ API endpoint verification
- üîÑ WebSocket connection testing
- üîÑ Full integration testing

## Next Session Requirements

### Immediate Actions Needed
1. **Resolve Docker Issue:** Fresh sandbox or alternative backend startup method
2. **Start Backend Services:** `docker-compose up -d` or individual service startup
3. **Configure Frontend Environment:** Set up `.env` files with correct API endpoints
4. **Install Frontend Dependencies:** `npm install` in frontend directory
5. **Start Frontend Development Server:** `npm run dev`
6. **Verify API Integration:** Test REST API calls to backend services
7. **Test WebSocket Connection:** Verify real-time communication works
8. **Run Test Suites:** Execute all tests to ensure integration quality

### Context to Preserve
- Current branch: `feature/frontend-evaluation-and-integration`
- Repository state: Frontend integrated, ready for backend startup
- Known working configuration: lovable.dev frontend passes all CI/CD
- Integration requirements: Documented in project context file

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Contextual Loss:** Without proper documentation handover, new session may miss critical project context
- **Docker Environment:** Persistent Docker issues may require multiple sandbox attempts

### Medium Risk
- **Integration Complexity:** Frontend-backend integration may reveal compatibility issues
- **Environment Configuration:** API endpoints and WebSocket URLs need careful configuration

### Low Risk
- **Code Quality:** Both frontend and backend have passing test suites
- **Repository Structure:** Clean monorepo structure established

## Recommendations for Future Sessions

### For Immediate Next Session
1. **Start with Docker resolution:** Attempt `docker-compose up -d` immediately
2. **Have backup plan:** Be prepared to run services individually if Docker Compose fails
3. **Prioritize integration testing:** Focus on API and WebSocket connectivity
4. **Document all configuration:** Record environment variables and settings

### For Long-term Project Management
1. **Maintain session logs:** Continue documenting decisions and activities
2. **Create integration guides:** Document successful integration steps for repeatability
3. **Establish testing protocols:** Define comprehensive integration test procedures
4. **Plan deployment strategy:** Prepare for production deployment considerations

- Simulation Controls: Simulation Controls: A user interface to start, stop, pause, and resume simulations, indicating the current simulation state.
- Metrics Dashboard: Metrics Dashboard: Displays key real-time metrics from running simulations to provide an overview of system performance, utilizing dynamic updates.
- Log Viewer: Log Viewer: Fetch and display structured logs.
- AI Design Assistant: AI-Powered Design Tool: Offers intelligent suggestions for optimizing system architecture based on performance metrics. This feature uses an AI tool to identify and suggest potential improvements.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: HSL(210, 60%, 50%) – A vibrant blue (#1A82E2) to represent stability, technology, and trust.
- Background color: HSL(210, 20%, 98%) – A very light blue (#F4FAFF) for a clean and professional canvas.
- Accent color: HSL(180, 50%, 40%) – A turquoise (#30A6A6) to add a touch of sophistication and highlight key interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' sans-serif for a modern, machined, objective, neutral look.
- Use minimalist and consistent icons to represent system components. The style will reflect a clean and technical aesthetic.
- Employ a grid-based layout for the Design Canvas and use clear visual hierarchy to organize the components and properties.
- Implement subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback and enhance user interaction, like smooth canvas panning and highlighting components.

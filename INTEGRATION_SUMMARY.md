- **User Service**: `localhost:8001` - User management and authentication
- **Project Service**: `localhost:8002` - Project lifecycle management
- **Design Service**: `localhost:8003` - Design data management
- **Simulation Orchestration**: `localhost:8004` - Simulation coordination
- **Go Simulation Engine**: `localhost:8080` - High-performance simulation execution

### Frontend Application (Running ✅)
- **React + TypeScript + Vite**: `localhost:12004`
- **Environment**: Configured to use `http://localhost:8000/api/v1`
- **API Client**: Properly configured with authentication support
- **Components**: Drag-and-drop canvas, property panels, simulation controls

### Infrastructure (Running ✅)
- **PostgreSQL**: Database for all services
- **Redis**: Caching and session management
- **Zookeeper**: Service coordination
- **Docker Compose**: Container orchestration

## 🔧 Configuration Details

### Frontend Configuration
```typescript
// API Client configured with:
baseURL: 'http://localhost:8000/api/v1'
// Authentication: Bearer token support
// CORS: Enabled for cross-origin requests
```

### Backend Configuration
```yaml
# API Gateway routes:
/users -> User Service (8001)
/projects -> Project Service (8002)
/designs -> Design Service (8003)
/simulations -> Simulation Service (8004)
```

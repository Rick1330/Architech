# Introduction to Architech Studio

Architech Studio is a web-based visual design tool for creating, simulating, and validating distributed system architectures. It provides an intuitive drag-and-drop canvas interface to build complex systems, run real-time simulations based on defined properties, and gain actionable insights into performance, resilience, and potential bottlenecks.

## Core Features

-   **Visual Design Canvas:** A dynamic, interactive canvas where users can drag, drop, and connect components representing various parts of a system architecture (e.g., services, databases, load balancers).
-   **Component-Based Architecture:** A rich palette of predefined system components, each with configurable properties that influence simulation behavior.
-   **Real-time Simulation:** A powerful simulation engine that consumes the user's design and runs a real-time simulation, providing live feedback on component status, metrics, and logs.
-   **Observability Dashboards:** Integrated dashboards for viewing key performance indicators (KPIs), latency charts, and structured logs generated during a simulation.
-   **AI-Powered Optimization:** A built-in AI Design Assistant that analyzes a system's architecture and simulation results to provide actionable optimization suggestions.
